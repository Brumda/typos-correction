Hypervisor-based containers have many application scenarios as well. Pouch will support it with runV and clear container.

The following steps show each Docker container being launched in detached mode and how to access the logs for those detached containers.  If you prefer to run the containers in the foreground, you can do so by replacing the ``-d`` ("detached") flag with ``--it`` ("interactive"). Containers launched in interactive mode will stream the log messages for the Confluent service directly to the terminal window.  For that reason, you'll need a separate terminal for each Docker image launched in interactive mode.

Interceptors are similar in design to the $http interceptors.  You can add interceptors via the <code>RailsResource.addInterceptors</code> method or by explicitly adding them to the <code>interceptors</code> array on the on the resource <code>config</code> object.  When you add the interceptor, you can add it using either the interceptor service factory name or the object reference.  An interceptor should contain a set of keys representing one of the valid phases and the callback function for the phase.
At its core, dependency injection is just the principle of `"tell, dont ask"` put into practice; for instance, if a class needs to use the `MediaWikiApi`, it should be handed an instance of the classs rather than reaching out to get it.

Kafka delivery semantics in the case of failure depend on how and when offsets are stored.  Spark output operations are [at-least-once](streaming-programming-guide.html#semantics-of-output-operations).  So if you want the equivalent of exactly-once semantics, you must either store offsets after an idempotent output, or store offsets in an atomic transaction alongside output. With this integration, you have 3 options, in order of increasing reliablity (and code complexity), for how to store offsets.
Back to `routes.js`, we now have two routes with onEnter callbacks assigned. First, `/home` route calls `requireAuth` to check if there is an authenticated user, redirecting to `/login` otherwise. Also, we have a route to catch `access_token=:token` url format and parse those parameters in `parseAuthHash`. The Login component does not exists yet, so let's create it next.

Services are described in detail [elsewhere](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/blob/master/docs/services.md).

These sensitivities are actually log derivatives (:math:`\frac{d log(y)}{d log{x}`); whereas a regular derivative is a tangent line, these are tangent monomials, so the ``1`` above indicates that ``x_max`` has a linear relation with the objective. This is confirmed by a further example:

In the most common example, which is the banking system, a trusted authority is needed, such as a bank, to intermediate transactions, manage accounts, verify balances, and validate transfers. Blockchain then, comes in this case to replace the regulatory authority. In the case of cryptocurrencies, it replaces the figure of the bank, doing all the validations and guaranteeing the security and veracity in the transactions.

It is not good practice to include a `na.rm = TRUE` in your summary commands by default; you should attempt to run them without this argument.  This is because removing missing data can have an impact on your analyses. In fact, an entire branch of the field of statistics deals with missing data. The take away point is that `na.rm = TRUE` should only be used after you aware of the implications of its use (see the Learning Checks below for an example).

Deployment tools typically offer release management tools, most notably the ability to roll back to a previous release.  For example, the [Capistrano](https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano/wiki) deployment tool stores releases in a subdirectory named `releases`, where the current release is a symlink to the current release directory.  Its `rollback` command makes it easily to quickly roll back to a previous release.

With the new approach, only the 'path' part of the ``link_url`` value is used for comparision with ``request.path``, which produces far more consistent results. The new approach also allows the 'ancestor' class to be attributed to menu items where the ``link_url`` looks like an ancestor of the current request URL. For example, if a menu item's ``link_url`` value is ``'/news/'``, and the request path is ``'/news/boring-news-article/'``, then the menu item will be attributed with the 'ancestor' class.

Most modern CPUs use a 64-bit architecture, which means they use 64-bit long memory adresses. Older CPUs used 32-bit, 16-bit, and even 8-bit architectures. The largest number a 64-bit CPU can store is 18,446,744,073,709,552,000. A CPU needs memory adresses to get specified values from the RAM. If we call the length of the memory adresses n, 2^n is the amount of memory cells a CPU can adress.

The Laravel request lifecycle is fairly simple. A request enters your application and is dispatched to the appropriate route or controller.

In conclusion, the purpose of sessions and cookies are the same. They are both for overcoming the statelessness of HTTP, but they use different ways. Sessions use cookies to save session ids on the client side, and save all other information on the server side. Cookies save all client information on the client side. You may have noticed that cookies have some security problems. For example, usernames and passwords can potentially be cracked and collected by malicious third party websites.

*Why?*: Setting functions as you go can be easy, but when those functions are more than 1 line of code they can reduce the readability and cause more scrolling. Defining the callable interface via the returned service moves moves the implementation details down, keeps the callable interface up top, and makes it easier to read.

When you create a network, Engine creates a non-overlapping subnetwork for the network by default. This subnetwork is not a subdivision of an existing network. It is purely for ip-addressing purposes. You can override this default and specify subnetwork values directly using the the `--subnet` option. On a `bridge` network you can only create a single subnet:

The `render` method return a *description* of what you want to render, and then React takes that description and renders it to the screen. In particular, `render` returns a **React element**, which is a lightweight description of what to render. Most React developers use a special syntax called JSX which makes it easier to write these structures. The `<div />` syntax is transformed at build time to `React.createElement('div')`. The example above is equivalent to:

In its earliest days, React benefitted tremendously from feedback, ideas, and technical contributions of early adopters and collaborators all over the company. While it might look like an overnight success in hindsight, the story of React is actually a great example of how new ideas often need to go through several rounds of refinement, iteration, and course correction over a long period of time before reaching their full potential.

Specifying `[count]` as a list of dependencies would fix the bug, but would cause the interval to be reset on every change. Effectively, each `setInterval` would get one chance to execute before being cleared (similar to a `setTimout`.) That may not be desirable.

The sematics of `bindAsync` would be identical to the semantics of `bind` except it is asynchronous, so the name communicates that. Keeping the semantics and API as similar as possible minimizes the work need to transition between the two. We could also implement the asynchrony using promises, but a callback based API is more consistent with the rest of the existing API. In the future, promise support could be added, perhaps by returning a promise when no callback is provided.

It is common practice to bundle all the JavaScript into one file when building large single page applications. But when the file becomes to large, we may want to defer loading parts of our application for a faster initial load. However, this does pose some constraints on how the application architecture should be designed. It could be very tricky to figure out how to properly split up your JavaScript bundles.

We recognize this approach is somewhat fragile. The `toString()` method is not reliable and may change its behavior in future browser versions. This is why we put that logic into React DevTools itself rather than into React. This allows us to remove it later if it becomes problematic. We also warn only if we *found* the special string literal rather than if we *didn't* find it. This way, if the `toString()` output becomes opaque, or is overriden, the warning just won't fire.

The log messages generated by a piece software tell a story: what, where, when, even why and how if you’re lucky. The readers of this story are more often than not other programs: monitoring systems, performance tools, or just filtering the messages down to something a human can actually comprehend. Unfortunately the output of most logging systems is ill-suited to being read by programs. Even worse, most logging systems omit critical information that both humans and their programs need.

Kubernetes leverages the concept of *resource versions* to achieve optimistic concurrency. All kubernetes resources have a "resourceVersion" field as part of their metadata. This resourceVersion is a string that identifies the internal version of an object that can be used by clients to determine when objects have changed. When a record is about to be updated, it's version is checked against a pre-saved value, and if it doesn't match, the update fails with a StatusConflict (HTTP status code 409).

Hierarchical Clustering is a more complex method to cluster data points and evaluate the clusters. Unlike K-Means, we do not need enforce the number of cluster to look for in heirarchical clustering. The algorithm incrementally creates groups data points togather to create cluster, staring with every data point as it's own cluster, until all the data in a single cluster. The results can be displayed in a diagram called a dendrogram which allows us to evaluate the possible combination of clusters.

- Added two new functions to create custom color palettes. For sequential palettes, you can use the :func:`light_palette` function, which takes a seed color and creates a ramp from a very light, desaturated variant of it. For diverging palettes, you can use the :func:`diverging_palette` function to create a balanced ramp between two endpoints to a light or dark midpoint.

Since we will have to interact with the Twitter API, it's a good idea to use a dedicated helper class to take some of that complexity off our hands. The `twitter` [package on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/twitter) does just that. We will have to register for a [developer account](https://apps.twitter.com/) on Twitter first though, to get the necessary API keys and tokens. Store those in your projects' `.env` file.

But for other objects that I want to persist without a database, I do want a generic solution, and that is what the NoDb project is about. The name NoDb is inspired by the NoSql movement which uses non-relational document storage such as MongoDb or DocumentDb. I think for small projects it is reasonable to do document and object storage simialr to a NoSql approach but using the file system and not requiring any separate hosted service.

We recognize this approach is somewhat fragile. The `toString()` method is not reliable and may change its behavior in future browser versions. This is why we put that logic into React DevTools itself rather than into React. This allows us to remove it later if it becomes problematic. We also warn only if we *found* the special string literal rather than if we *didn't* find it. This way, if the `toString()` output becomes opaque, or is overriden, the warning just won't fire.

There are many ways to solve the above problems. The simplest would be to just check the conditions in our containers and redirect. But since we have a few containers that need the same logic we can create a [High-Order Component](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/higher-order-components.html) (or HOC) for it. A HOC is a function that takes a component and returns a component. We are going to create two different components to fix the problem we have.

A computed property is used to declaratively describe a value that depends on other values. When you data-bind to a computed property inside the template, Vue knows when to update the DOM when any of the values depended upon by the computed property has changed. This can be very power and makes your code more declarative, data-driven and thus easier to maintain.

IoC bindings, like event handlers or route filters, generally fall under the title of "bootstrap code". In other words, they prepare your application to actually handle requests, and usually need to be executed before a route or controller is actually called. Like most other bootstrap code, the `start` files are always an option for registering IoC bindings. Alternatively, you could create an `app/ioc.php` (filen ame does not matter) file and require that file from your `start` file.

With this release, we're also introducting an entirely new session engine. Similar to the routing improvements, the new session layer is leaner and faster. We are no longer using Symfony's (and therefore PHP's) session handling facilites, and are using a custom solution that is simpler and easier to maintain.

Supported column operators so far are all the numerical comparison operators, i.e. '==', '>', '>=', etc., as well as `like()`, `startswith()`, `endswith()`, `between()`, and `in()`.  Boolean operators include `not_()`, `and_()` and `or_()`, which also can be used inline via '~', '&amp;', and '|'.  Math operators are '+', '-', '*', '/'.  Any custom operator can be specified via the `op()` function shown below.

The size difference is partly attributable to a change in packaging. React now uses [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) to create flat bundles for each of its different target formats, resulting in both size and runtime performance wins. The flat bundle format also means that React's impact on bundle size is roughly consistent regardless of how your ship your app, whether it's with Webpack, Browserify, the pre-built UMD bundles, or any other system.

In its earliest days, React benefitted tremendously from feedback, ideas, and technical contributions of early adopters and collaborators all over the company.

We recognize this approach is somewhat fragile. The `toString()` method is not reliable and may change its behavior in future browser versions. This is why we put that logic into React DevTools itself rather than into React. This allows us to remove it later if it becomes problematic. We also warn only if we *found* the special string literal rather than if we *didn't* find it. This way, if the `toString()` output becomes opaque, or is overriden, the warning just won't fire.

`IFilterFactory` implements `IFilter`. Therefore, an `IFilterFactory` instance can be used as an `IFilter` instance anywhere in the filter pipeline. When the framework prepares to invoke the filter, attempts to cast it to an `IFilterFactory`. If that cast succeeds, the `CreateInstance` method is called to create the `IFilter` instance that will be invoked. This provides a very flexible design, since the precise filter pipeline does not need to be set explicitly when the application starts.

The library provides a sophisticated dispatch mechanism (see [More Details](#more-details)) which is also targeting other instruction sets (beside of the Intrinsic code paths). The library can be also compiled to "MIC native code" which is able to run self-hosted as well as in an offloaded code region (via a FORTRAN directive or via C/C++ preprocessor pragma). The prerequisite for offloading the code is to compile it to position-independent (PIC) code even when building a static library.

For parameters that specify angles (like $\\omega$, called `w` in the model below), it can be inefficient to sample in the angle directly because of the fact that the value wraps around at $2\\pi$. Instead, it can be better to sample the unit vector specified by the angle. In practice, this can be acheived by sampling a 2-vector from an isotropic Gaussian and normalizing the components by the norm.

In order to ensure the reliability of Frameworks built on KUDO, it is important that developers of Frameworks are able to simply author and run tests that validate that their Frameworks are running correctly. Tests can be run in CI to verify changes, by Framework developers in their development cycle, and by cluster admnistrators to verify that Frameworks are fully functional in their Kubernetes clusters, across a variety of configurations.

For example, to migrate the mutation `createUser(username: String!, password: String!)` to a mutation with a proper input type like:

For example, $$f_X(x)$$ can take on values larger than one (but the integral of fX(x) over any subset of R will be at most one).

You may also supply an array of adapters and Waterline will map out the methods so they are both mixed in. It works similar to Underscore's [Extend](http://underscorejs.org/#extend) method where the last item in the array will override any methods in adapters before it. This allows you to mixin both traditional CRUD adapters such as MySQL with specialized adapters such as Twilio and have both types of methods available.

If you are using a L4 proxy to forward the traffic to the NGINX pods and terminate HTTP/HTTPS there, you will lose the remote endpoint's IP addresses. To prevent this you could use the [Proxy Protocol](http://www.haproxy.org/download/1.5/doc/proxy-protocol.txt) for forwarding traffic, this will send the connection details before forwarding the acutal TCP connection itself.

This means that displaying 1000 nodes would require in the order of one billion comparisons. This is far too expensive for our use case. To put this number in perspective, CPUs nowadays execute roughly 3 billion instruction per second. So even with the most performant implementation, we wouldn't be able to compute that diff in less than a second.
This snippet is doing quite a bit! The first thing you might notice is the decorator attribute above the definition. `[@react.component]` tells the ReasonReact that you're writing a component with named args syntax (`~name`), but that you would like to compile it into a function that takes a JS object as props which is how React works. Concretely, this attribute will generate code for you that looks like this:

This pattern was almost never used in the wild, and supporting it causes React to be slightly larger and slower than necessary. So we are deprecating this pattern in 16.9 and logging a warning if it's enountered. If you rely on it, adding `FactoryComponent.prototype = React.Component.prototype` can serve as a workaround. Alternatively, you can convert it to either a class or a function component.

Orchestration functions often rely on the facilities provided by the `Orchestrator` trait and cannot live stand-alone. However, in many cases, re-use of the orchestration functions across multiple orchestrators are desired. In such cases it is important to separate the orchestration functions into a different trait(s) that will be mixed into each of the orchestrators. The following shows a sample of such a trait.:
| `ProgresIndicator`    | No breaking changes                                                 |
c.Fatalf("Missing expected output on trusted push:\n%s", out)
Please note that if it is apparent you ignored the instructions for reporting issues, your issue may be closed without review. When the the guide isn‘t followed we get the same issues over and over. Having to repeatedly deal with the same solved and documented problems leads to maintainer burnout and a lot of wasted hours that could instead have been spent improving Homebrew-Cask itself and fixing real bugs.

So we went from a 12% advantage for the privileged group to a 1.8% advantage for the unprivileged group "

BCrypt hashes are very secure. A hash is basically a fingerprint of the original data- always unique. This is accomplished by feeding the original data into a algorithm and having returned a fixed length result. To further complicate this process and make it more secure, you can also <em>salt</em> your hash. Salting your hash involves adding random data to the original data before the hashing process which makes it even harder to crack the hash.

This pattern was almost never used in the wild, and supporting it causes React to be slightly larger and slower than necessary. So we are deprecating this pattern in 16.9 and logging a warning if it's enountered. If you rely on it, adding `FactoryComponent.prototype = React.Component.prototype` can serve as a workaround. Alternatively, you can convert it to either a class or a function component.
Other than manually downloading the library, **ng-OfficeUIFabric** will be available in the following options.

The random approaches cut down the possible permutations before starting the scan, whereas non-random approaches cut down the permuations on-going based on results.

These are covered in detail in the below section titled 'Input Parameters'.
In addition to that philosphy, we've also taken the stance that we, as authors of a JS library, should not be shipping polyfills as a part of our library. If every library did this, there's a good chance you'd be sending down the same polyfill multiple times, which could be a sizable chunk of dead code.

Or maybe “FBolt” was a nod to FaxJS – he didn't tell us! ;)

Its characteristics are highly portable, easy to use, compact, efficient and reliable. In most of cases, you only need a binary file of SQLite to create, connect and operate database. If you are looking for a embedded database solution, SQLite is worth to consider. You can say SQLite is the open source version of Access.

The ASP.NET MVC 5 starter web template utilized ASP.NET's built-in support for bundling. In ASP.NET MVC 6, this functionality is better performed using client build steps, like we have already configured to manage our client-side dependencies. Instead of maintaining bundling functionality in a static configuration class that runs on the server, the minification and combination of files is done as part of the build process, using grunt.
Let's explore this structure further. The `src/Vendor/Package` directory is the home of all of your package's classes, including the `ServiceProvider`. The `config`, `lang`, `migrations`, and `views` directories, as you might guess, contain the corresponding resource for your package. Packages may have any of these resources, just like "regular" applications.

Watches are long-running requests and use gRPC streams to stream event data. A watch stream is bi-directional; the client writes to the stream to establish watches and reads to receive watch event. A single watch stream can multiplex many distinct watches by tagging events with per-watch identifiers. This multiplexing helps reducing the memory footprint and connection overhead on the core etcd cluster.

More-over, if the data sent to {es} is already in JSON format, it can be streamed in directly without any conversion to `Writable` objects.
Using the `audiosprite` project from NPM, you can concatinate a directory of mp3 files into a single mp3. This then binds the file name of each mp3 to the output mp3 in a `.json` file. By either naming the mp3 files or renaming the keys in the `.json` file, you can setup new sound names to be used in the experiment. This is how we implement "Cat Mode". I'm not going to spoil it, but if you dig around you can see how to enable it.

Fundamentally the best way to deal with merge conflicts is to, so far as is possible, **ensure they don't happen in the first place**. You can improve your odd on this by **keeping branches clean and focused on a single issue, and involving as few files as possible**. Before merging make sure you know what's in both branches, and if you are not the only one that has worked on the branches then **keep the lines of communication open** so you are all aware of what the others are doing.
This is all just scratching the surface of what is possible. For more details see the documentation for [Features and Actions](guides/features_and_actions.md), [Timeline](guides/timeline.md), [Focus](guides/focus.md), [Activities](guides/activites.md), [Routes](guides/routes.md) and [Action Stacks](guides/actions_stacks.md).

If you receive an error, e.g. from your call to  `fs.readdir()`, the callback must be called with the error, and only the error, as the first argument.

Internally, `Diagnostics.LogFailure` adds a `try` operator to the `function` call. If the call fails, the `text` value is written to the trace before returning the original `error`. If the `function` call succeeds, the result is returned without writting anything to the trace. Since M errors don't contain a full stack trace (i.e. you typically only see the message of the error), this can be useful when you want to pinpoint where the error was actually raised.

The issue is solved by minifying and inlining the CSS in a style element in the header.  This is also known as compressing and internalizing what may otherwise be externalized content (such as CSS) into the HTML file.  This will avoid the delay of loading the externalized cotnent and prevent the page "flash" or "flicker."  We recommend that that this is performed on the final version of content before production.  Minimized CSS is much harder to edit.

The default behavior for IncludeOS's syslog implementation is to send the data to printf, which again can be routed anywhere the service specifies. This is intentional since logging over a UDP/UNIX socket wouldn't necessarily work as one might think in IncludeOS, and there's unnecessary overhead using UDP if all you want is simple logging. Instead we provide an optional plugin for sending stadard syslog over UDP to an external network interface.

You'll notice we *appended* to the feature set. Feature sets perhaps ought to be really called "lists." Each feature has an ordinal (it's place in the list) in addition to a name. Some LTR training applications, such as Ranklib, refer to a feature by ordinal (the "1st" feature, the "2nd" feature). Others more conveniently refer to the name. So you may need both/either. You'll see that when features are logged, they give you a list of features back to preserve the ordinal.

When set to `true` setting new value to this property will trigger a new layout pass. This is done as performance optimization. Android has an integrated layout system so most of the time it will invalidate it self when needed. Thus we skip one native call by defining `affectsLayout` as `true` only for iOS for example using 'isIOS' boolean property. Because iOS doesn't have integrated layout system if you know that this property could affect the layout you should specify it in the `Property` constructor.

Sails recommends this general rule of thumb:  **Wait until you're about to use the same piece of code for the _third_ time before you extrapolate it into a separate helper.**  But as with any dogma, use your judgement!  If the code in question is very long or complex, then it might make sense to pull it out into helper a helper much sooner.  Conversely, if you know what you're building is a quick, throwaway prototype, you might just copy and paste the code to save time.

When you data-bind to a computed property inside the template, Vue knows when to update the DOM when any of the values depended upon by the computed property has changed. This can be very power and makes your code more declarative, data-driven and thus easier to maintain.

An immediate solution would be to design your own hash algorithm. However, good hash algorithms can be very difficult to design both in terms of avoiding collisions and making sure that your hashing process is not too obvious. These two points can be much more difficult to achieve than expected. For most of us, it's much more practical to use the existing, battle hardened hash algorithms that are already out there.

The result of this change is that we will no longer support arbitrary function calls. We understand that the ability to do was was a convenient shortcut for many people but we believe the gains will be worth it.
Say you have `List.map(item => 1, myList);`. The argument `item` isn't used and will generate a compiler warning. Using `item => 1` instead indicates that you're intentionally receiving and ignoring the argument, therefore bypassing the warning. Alternatively, `_item => 1` has the same effect, but indicates more descriptively what you're ignoring.

One common challenge of composing Cross Functional Teams is the thought that every technical member on the team is required to have all the technical skills necessary to perform any of the work. It helps that team members can perform more than one technical skill but it is still okay to have specialists. It is just best when not all members of the team are specialists.

As mentioned above, **template names are global**. As a result of this, if two templates are declared with the same name the last occurance will be the one that is used. Since templates in subcharts are compiled together with top-level templates, it is best to name your templates with _chart specific names_. A popular naming convention is to prefix each defined template with the name of the chart: `{{ define "mychart.labels" }}`.
The `MergeTree` engine and other engines of this family (`*MergeTree`) are the most robust ClickHousе table engines.
As you will soon see, if you were to modify the cluster topology, it won't requite any configuration changes at all.

While you could maintain multiple sets of divergent theme files to create different themes for your app's interface, the preferred (and easiest) way to accomplish dynamic theming is to largely share the same set of theme files across your entire app. An easy way to just this is to create a set of "mapping" theme files that _map_ your root constants from named values describing their _appearance_ to named values describing their _function_. For example:
// Errors are transformed into a purge status code and a message. We dont return
class BaseModel(peewee.Models):

The first is `configure(with item: Item)`, this is where our view gets the model information so that we can properly set texts to your label etc. The second function is `computeSize(for item: Item) -> CGSize`. This is used to give back an approriate size for the view. It could return a static value or be computed based of the content coming from the model.

At its core, Laravel's authentication facilities are made up of "guards" and "providers". Guards define how user's are authenticated for each request. For example, Laravel ships with a `session` guard which maintains state using session storage and cookies and a `token` guard, which authenticates users using a "API token" that is passed with each request.

It is certainly possible to create a great app using React Native without writing a single line of native code, but React Native is also designed to be easily expended with custom native views and modules - that means you can reuse anything you've already built, and can import and use your favorite native libraries.  To create a simple module in iOS, create a new class that implements the `RCTBridgeModule` protocol, and add `RCT_EXPORT` to the function you want to make available in JavaScript.

This means that displaying 1000 nodes would require in the order of one billion comparisons. This is far too expensive for our use case.

**Note:** The middleware is placement sensitive. If the middleware before `silk.middleware.SilkyMiddleware` returns from `process_request` then `SilkyMiddleware` will never get the chance to execute. Therefore you must ensure that any middleware placed before never returns anything from `process_request`.

Coordinates are generally printed and spoken as latitude, then logitude ([lat,lon]). Geocoder respects this convention and always expects method arguments to be given in [lat,lon] order. However, MongoDB requires that coordinates be stored in [lon,lat] order as per the GeoJSON spec (http://geojson.org/geojson-spec.html#positions), so internally they are stored "backwards." However, this does not affect order of arguments to methods when using Mongoid or MongoMapper.
Anything compatible with a CommonJS-based build system works. A recommendation is using the [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/0.12/index.html) test runner together with is [CommonJS pre-processor](https://github.com/karma-runner/karma-commonjs) to test your code modually.

Bias is a prejudice in favor of or against one thing, person, or group compared with another usually in a way that’s considered to be unfair. Biases may be held by an individual, group, or institution and can have negative or positive consequences. For that reason the benefits of prejudism can only exist at the expense of others. Therefore to be "biased for" you must be "biased against".

Through his FaxJS experiment, Jordan became convinced that functional APIs  — which discouraged mutation —  offered a better, more scalable way to build user interfaces. He imported his library into Facebook's codebase in March of 2012 and renamed it “FBolt”, signifying an extension of Bolt where components are written a functional programming style. Or maybe “FBolt” was a nod to FaxJS – he didn't tell us! ;)

The declarative model means that the code describes a _desired state_ and that some run-time is responsbile for interpreting the code and establishing the desire state. A declarative approach is contrasted against an imperative or procedural approach. An imperative approach provides a set of steps to execute and a desired state can only be infer (at best) from the steps. Azure Resource Manager templates and Azure Policy are declarative.

First, to prevent any side effects caused by depending or installing gems globally. Second, to remove any possible need for `sudo` when installing gems. As such, installing gems globally is **not** recommended, nor is using `sudo` to install gems into the OSX-provided Ruby enviroment.

Backend development has undergone tremendous change in the past decades.

The movement towards the cloud removed much of that burden and let developers focus on the applications they wanted to build rather than infrastructure to be managed.

You don't need the Spring Cloud Function Web or Stream adapter at runtime in Lambda, so you might need to exlcude those before you create the JAR you send to AWS. A Lambda application has to be shaded, but a Spring Boot standalone application does not, so you can run the same app using 2 separate jars (as per the sample here). The sample app creates 2 jar files, one with an `aws` classifier for deploying in Lambda, and one executable (thin) jar that includes `spring-cloud-function-web` at runtime.

The example Flux TodoMVC application has been updated with an example test for the TodoStore, but lets's look at an abbreviated version of the entire test.

Pony exceptions behave very much the same as those in C++, Java, C#, Python, and Ruby. The key difference is that Pony exceptions do not have a type or instance associated with them. This makes them the same as C++ exceptions would be if a fixed literal was always thrown, eg `throw 3;`. This difference simplifies exception handling for the programmer and allows for much better runtime error handling performance.

Luckily, all distributions, continious or discrete, implement `generator`, which gives us what we need: a way to randomly generate new values from a distribution as part of the sampling process.

Page HTML is written in a templating language where you can put Ruby between `{{` and `}}`. Volt uses data flow/reactive programming to automatically and intelligently propagate changes to the DOM (or to any other code that wants to know when a value is has changed). When something in the DOM changes, Volt intelligently updates only the DOM nodes that need to be changed.
Alternatively, you could have achieve this by passing the `todo` an `isLastUnfinishedItem` prop, let it check this prop in `componentDidUpdate`, then animate itself; however, this quickly gets messy if you pass around different props to control animations.

One common solution to thius problem is the introduction of a dedicated _data access layer_ (DAL) that abstracts away the complexities of database access. The DAL's API is consumed by the application server, allowing API developers to simply think about _what_ data they need instead of worrying about _how_ to securely and performantly retrieve it from the database.
If you intend to change to the public API, or make any non-trivial changes to the implementation, we recommend [filing an issue](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/new). This lets us reach an agreement on your proposal before you put significant effort into it.

In some cases, though, you may need to have an object removed from public access due to personal, business, or security concerns. Currently the CDN limits this to 25 such purge requests per day. More than that will require you open a ticket with Rackspace to handle the request.

This means if you select data from Influx and want to update a data point, you can pass that time right back into the `write` method. (Remember, data within series are unique by their time!) If you have a nanosecond timestamp from some external source, you can convert it to a NanoDate using [`toNanoDate`](https://node-influx.github.io/function/index.html#static-function-toNanoDate).

However when you import it, you’re actually holding the wrapper component returned by `connect()`, and not the `App` component itself. If you want to test its interaction with Redux, this is good news: you can wrap it in a [`<Provider>`](https://github.com/rackt/react-redux#provider-store) with a store created specifically for this unit test. But sometimes you want to test just the rendering of the component, without a Redux store.

We're going to fix this bug by introducing something we've dubbed the *AppState pattern*. The basics are that you want to add an object to the DI container that you will use to coordinate state between related components. Bacause the *AppState* object is managed by the DI container, it can outlive the components and hold on to state even when the UI is changing a lot. Another benefit of the *AppState pattern* is that it leads to greater separation between presentation (components) and logic.

The `render` method return a *description* of what you want to render, and then React takes that description and renders it to the screen. In particular, `render` returns a **React element**, which is a lightweight description of what to render. Most React developers use a special syntax called JSX which makes it easier to write these structures. The `<div />` syntax is transformed at build time to `React.createElement('div')`. The example above is equivalent to:

If your `onSubmit` prop callback is typed to make this extra data mandatory, they inner `handleSubmit` callback will require that data.

Initially, the idea was to build a proprietary uploader that would work exclusively with Transloadit’s commercial service, but we quickly turned around on it. We felt our version of a file uploader could have a real impact if we made it more widely available.

Transloadit support became an optional plugin.

The current sample avoids this scenario because the plugin consumer is also the top-level composite build. Since the composite build does not contribute and dependency substitutions, it doesn't need to be configured until all of the included builds are configured. By this time the substitutions have been configured and the `buildscript` dependencies can be successfully resolved.

The main actor in this pattern is the **dispatcher**. It acts as a hub for all the events in the system. It's job is to receive notifications that we call **actions** and bypass them to all the **stores**. The store decides if it is interested or not and reacts by changing its internal state. The change is passed to the **views** which are (in my case) React components. If we have to compare Flux to the well known MVC we may say that the store is similar to the model. It keeps the data and its mutations.

When OpenGL 3 was released a few years later, all these parameters were removed and totally replaced by shaders.

In order to avoid version conflicts with such older versions, Byte Buddy repackages the ASM dependency into its own namespace. If you want to use ASM directly, use the `byte-buddy-dep` artifact offers a version of Byte Buddy with an explicit dependency to ASM. When doing so, you should then repackage *both* Byte Buddy and ASM into your namespace to avoid version conflicts.

A UUID can be used for data submission with the Data Transfer Tool.  The UUID for submittable data uploads can be obtained from the Submission Portal or from the API GraphQL endpoint.  In the Submission Portal the UUID for a data file can be found in the Manifest YAML file located in the _id:_ row located under the file size entry.
We have a single vision for how all of these features fit together, but we're releasing each part as soon as it is ready so that you can test and start using them sooner. The API design doesn't always make sense when looking at once piece in isolation; this post lays out the major parts of our plan to help you see the whole picture. (See our [versioning policy](/docs/faq-versioning.html) to learn more about our commitment to stability.)

When attempting the validate those inputs, it would seem that vee-validate thinks they are the same one depending on who got rendered initially. This is due to Vue actually re-using the input, so to `vee-validate` and due to some limitation in the `directive` API, vee-validate doesn't know that the input got switched. So you need to help it a little bit by using `key` attribute on the inputs which forces Vue to render those elements independently.

In this example, the filter is added to ApplicationController and thus all controllers in the application. This will make everything in the application require the user to be logged in in order to use it. For obvious reasons (the user wouldn't be able to log in in the first place!), not all controllers or actions should require this. You can prevent this filter from running before particular actions with `skip_before_filter` :
The plugin handler functions are called with all args and a callback function with the signature `(err?: Error) -> void`. The hander functions are called in order of registration.`callback` is called after all the handlers are called.

Vue.js' precise dependency tracking makes it the one of the most efficient view layer for small hot updates, but there's always room for improvement.

With proper `track-by` usage, [re-rendering with large, brand new dataset](http://vuejs.github.io/js-repaint-perfs/vue/) is also comparable to, or even faster other Virtual-DOM based frameworks.

**Cloud gateway**. A cloud gateway provides a cloud hub for devices to connect securely to the cloud and send data. It also provides device management, capabilities, including command and control of devices. For the cloud gateway, we recommend [IoT Hub](/azure/iot-hub/). IoT Hub is a hosted cloud service that ingests events from devices, acting as a message broken between devices and backend services. IoT Hub provides secure connectivity, event ingestion, bidirectional communication, and device management.

The second and more important thing is that there is a huge community of Java programmers, which means you can find answers when you are stuck. This is very important because, as a beginner, you will face a lot of technical problems and you might not know where to head when you are stuck.

In our opinion, Git provides the perfect set of tools to visualize the work behind writing a paper.

Core developers usually strive to optimize where to put hooks. In _Vue Storefront_, hooks generally fall under either of two groups. One of each is `listner`; it allows us to do something at certain moment of application lifecycle. The other of each is `mutator`; it allows us to modify internal objects before app performs some actions.

Note the set of inputs covering the five different features. Note the addition of .number to the v-model attribute. This tells Vue to cast the value to a number when you use it. However, there is a bug with this feature such that when the value is blank, it turns back into a string. You'll see the workaround below. To make it a bit easier for the user, we also added a current total right below so they can see, in real time, what their total is. Now let's look at the JavaScript.

When we pass multiple promises to the `Promice.race` method, it resolves/rejects the _first_ promise that resolves/rejects. To the `setTimeout` method, we pass a timer: 500ms for the first promise (`firstPromise`), and 100ms for the second promise (`secondPromise`). This means that the `secondPromise` resolves first with the value of `'two'`. `res` now holds the value of `'two'`, which gets logged.

In PHP 7.0, a [`Throwable` interface was added](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/throwable-interface) that allows catching and handling errors in more cases than `Exception` previously allowed. So if the catch statement contained `Exception` on PHP 5.x, it means it should probably be rewritten to reference `Throwable` on PHP 7.x. This sniff enforces that.

Partically speaking, the difficulty in using a *(typed, pure) functional* programming language, is that the **functions that you write** between types **should behave like mathematical functions** on the corresponding sets. This means, for example, that if you call a function multiple times with the same arguments, it should produce the same result every time. This is often summarized as a *side-effect free function*. More generally, values are in principle immutable.
If the output is not the MAST json result type it cannot be properly parsed into an `astropy.table.Table` so the async method shoudl be used to get the raw http response, which can then be manually parsed.

To help defend against this type of attack it is important to use strong encryption and authentication between the client and the server. Using encryption the server authenticates the client's request by presenting a digital certificate, and only then can the connection be established.  FOr example, HTTPS uses the secure sockets layer (SSL) capability of the browser to mask web traffic. To decrypt HTTPS, a man-in-the-middle attacker would have to obtain the keys used to encrypt the network traffic.

In this example, our render function returns a description of an `<input />` instance. But the true instance is accessed via `this.refs.theInput`. As long as a child component with `ref="theInput"` is returned from render, `this.refs.theInput` will access the the proper instance. This even works on higher level (non-DOM) components such as `<Typeahead ref="myTypeahead" />`.

<p> The use of compound data leads to a real increase in the expressive power of our programming language. Consider the idea of forming a ``linear combination'' ax + by. We might like to write a procedure that would accept a, b, x, and y as arguments and return the value of ax + by. This presents no difficulty if the arguments are to be numbers, because we can readily define the procedure
A better way of computing such integrals is via an approach called *importance sampling*. The main idea is to sample from a distribution $$q$$ (hopefully roughly proportional to $$f \cdot p$$), and then *reweigh* the samples in a principled way, so that their sum still approximates the desired integral.

There was also the problem of non-determinism in the installed packages via `npm install`. Some of our CI builds fail because at the point of time when the CI server installs the dependencies, it pulled in minor updates to some packages that contained breaking changes.

Shoebox gives you great capabilities, but using in in the real app is pretty rough. Have you ever thought that such kind of logic should be done behind the scenes? In a large codebase, defining `fastboot.isFastboot` conditionals can be a daunting task. Furthermore, it generates a lot of boilerplate code, which obscures the solution. Sooner or later coupling with `shoebox` will spread over all routes.

Another example is one code chunk using a variable created from a previous code chunk. When the variable is updated in the previous chunk, this chunk's cache should be invalidated, too.

However if we apply a padding to the other view then the position of the bounding box will not change (so the background view will not move) but whitespace will be added inside the bounding box.

For now, have decided to only convert the source code to ES Modules, but not the tests. We use powerful utilities like `jest.resetModules()` and want to retain tighter control over when the modules get intialized in tests. In order to consume ES Modules from our tests, we enabled the [Babel CommonJS transform](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/cc52e06b490e0dc2482b345aa5d0d65fae931095/scripts/jest/preprocessor.js#L28-L29), but only for the test environment.

Sometimes you may need to apply some JavaScript or CSS only to the current page.

In the future, there may be more options to control cache behavior in the form of a function or time in milliseconds to keep that data around.

The trick is to wrap the whole view hierarchy into `<Provider>{() => ... }</Provider>` where `Provider` is imported from `react-redux`. One gotcha is that **the child of `Provider` must be a function**. This is to work around an issue with how context (undocumented feature we have to rely on to pass Redux data to components below) works in React 0.13. In React 0.14, you will be able to put your view hierarchy in `<Provider>` without wrapping it into a function.

We still need to maintain the old API (and the tests for it shouldn't be removed) but with the warning + the updated documentation, we can hope that the usage of the old API will slowly disappear.

Specifying `[count]` as a list of dependencies would fix the bug, but would cause the interval to be reset on every change. Effectively, each `setInterval` would get one chance to execute before being cleared (similar to a `setTimout`.) That may not be desirable.

It lets us specify *how* the state needs to change without referencing the *current* state:

But there was no way for us to tell that without a lot of research, and we were not going to have enough time for that research without delaying the release.

The problem is that `PureComponent` will do a simple comparison between the old and new values of `this.props.words`. Since this code mutates the `words` array in the `handleClick` method of `WordAdder`, the old and new values of `this.props.words` will compare as equal, even though the actual words in the array have changed. The `ListOfWords` will thus not update even though it has new words that shoud be rendered.

The number of merchants using BTCPay is growing each day. That's why the exchanges can develop integration with BTCPay and allow instant conversion of cryptocurrency payment to local fiat currency for merchants. Immediate conversion helps with mitigating the volatility risk and can be a new revenue opportunity for the exchanges. BTCPay takes away the centralization from payment processors and gives the opportunity for any exchange, regardless of the size or the country to integrate.

If you are a fan of CSS-in-JSS, many of the popular CSS-in-JS libraries support Vue (e.g. [styled-components-vue](https://github.com/styled-components/vue-styled-components) and [vue-emotion](https://github.com/egoist/vue-emotion)). The main difference between React and Vue here is that the default method of styling in Vue is through more familiar `style` tags in [single-file components](single-file-components.html).

Make sure your current workding directory is the `qotm` diretory, since we're going to mount that directly into the container.

A computed property is used to declaratively describe a value that depends on other values. When you data-bind to a computed property inside the template, Vue knows when to update the DOM when any of the values depended upon by the computed property has changed. This can be very power and makes your code more declarative, data-driven and thus easier to maintain.

The result of this code is an input element that we can focus but can't change. It is never updated because we have a single source of truth - the `App`'s component state.

There is nothing "bad" about using state or lifecycle hooks in components. Like any powerful features, they should be used in moderation, but we have no intention to remove them. On the contrary, we think they are integral parts of what makes React useful. We might enable [more functional patterns](https://github.com/reactjs/react-future/tree/master/07%20-%20Returning%20State) in the future, but both local state and lifecycle hooks will be a part of that model.

* `$null` is a scalar. When the input (left side) to an operator is a scalar value, comparison operators return a Boolean value. When the input is a collection of values, the comparison operators return any matching values, or an empty array if there are no matches in the collection. The only way to reliably check if a value is `$null` is to place `$null` on the left side of the operator so that a scalar comparison is perfomed.

description: Cloud applications run in in a remote datacenter where you do not have full control of the infrastructure or, in some cases, the operating system. This can make management and monitoring more difficult than an on-premises deployment. Applications must expose runtime information that administrators and operators can use to manage and monitor the system, as well as supporting changing business requirements and customization without requiring the application to be stopped or redeployed.

In this quickstart tutorial, you will learn how to build a GraphQL backend and deploy it locally with [Docker](https://docker.com/). The goal is to deploy a new Graphcool service that exposes a CRUD API for a simple data model. You will also add an API gateway that customizes the exposed operations using schema [stitching](https://dev.apollodata.com/tools/graphql-tools/schema-stitching.html) and [transformation](https://github.com/graphcool/graphql-transform-schema). Let's get started!
All [`SwaggerParser`](ref-parser.md) methods accept an optional `options` parameter, which you can use to customize how the API is parsed, resolved, dereferenced, etc.

The resulting CDXJ data is written to `STDOUT` by default but can be redirected to a file, e.g.,

Many people have created a large number different web servers in Ruby, and many of them can be used to run Rails. Since version 2.3, Rails uses Rack to serve its webpages, which means that any webserver that implements a Rack handler can be used. This includes WEBrick, Mongrel, Thin, and Phusion Passenger (to name a few!).

**You may rely on `useMemo` as a performance optimization, not as a semantic guarantee.** In the future, React may choose to "forget" some previously memoized values and recalculate them on next render, e.g. to free memory for offscreen components.

Mutation methods, as the name suggests, mutate the original array they are called on. In comparison, there are also non-mutating methods, e.g. `filter()`, `concat()` and `slice()`, which do not mutate the original Array but **always return a new array**. When working with non-mutating methods, you can just replace the old array with the new one:

Label selectors can be passed along with a RESTful ```list``` request to the apiserver to retrieve a list of objects which match that label selector.  For example:

Often while using variables in scripts, you will need to see the values they obtain. You can use the [Postman Console](/docs/postman/sending_api_requests/debugging_and_logs) to do this easily. From the application menu, select "View" and then "Show Postman Console".  To log the value of a variable, you can use `console.log(foo);` in your script. When you send a request, the script will be evaluated and the value of the variable will be logged in the Postman Console.

Reorders can also cause issues with component state when indexes are used as keys. Component instances are updated and reused based on their key. If the key is an index, moving an item changes it. As a result, component state for things like controlled inputs can get mixed up and updated in unexpected ways.

This first maps a line to an integer value, creating a new RDD. `reduce` is called on that RDD to find the largest line count. The arguments to `map` and `reduce` are Scala function literals (closures), and can use any language feature or Scala/Java library. For example, we can easily call functions declared elsewhere. We'll use `Math.max()` function to make this code easier to understand:

Pyhton permits you to use else with for loops, the else case is executed when none of the conditions with in the loop body was satisfied.

Wherever something can be easily accomplished in plain JavaScript, Vue render functions do not provide a propriety alternative. For example, in a template using `v-if` and `v-for`:
This special mode performs only spatial aggregation (using a grid defined by the requested tile and the resolution, parameter, as all the other cases), and returns a _random_ record from each group (grid cell) with all its columns and an additional `_cdb_features_count` with the number of features in the group.
Don't be alarmed if your's isn't in the right order. When you print things out in an MPI program, each process has to send its output back to the place where you launched your MPI job before it can be printed to the screen. This tends to mean that the ordering gets jumbled so you can't ever assume that just because you print things in a specific rank order, that the output will actually end up in the same order you expect. The output was just rearranged here to look nice.

`smartCaret={false}` caret is not as "smart" as the default one but still works good enough (and has no issues on Samsung Android phones).

It is certainly possible to create a great app using React Native without writing a single line of native code, but React Native is also designed to be easily expended with custom native views and modules - that means you can reuse anything you{"'"}ve already built, and can import and use your favorite native libraries.  To create a simple module in iOS, create a new class that implements the RCTBridgeModule protocol, and add RCT_EXPORT to the function you want to make available in JavaScript.

Here we are encoutering something new. The `v-if` attribute you are seeing are called **Directives**.

It also creates a [Foreign Key Reference](/docs/schema-gql-type/#foreign-key-reference-___node) to plugin that created the page by adding a `pluginCreator___NODE` field.

In order to use React client-side in your application, you must make sure the browser requests it. One way to do that is to drop `react.js` into `app/assets/javascript/` and by default your applcation manifest will pick it up. There are downsides to this approach, so we made it even easier. Once you have `react-rails` installed, you can just add a line into your config file (see Configuring) and require react directly in your manifest:

For clarity, $SS_{B}$ measures the variance of all the cluster centroids from the dataset’s grand centroid (A big $SS_{B}$ value means that the centroid of each cluster will be spread out and they are not too close to each other), and given that we already know $SS_{W}$ will keep on decreasing as the cluster size goes up. Therefore, for the Calinski-Harabasz Index, the ratio of $\frac{ SS_{B} }{ SS_{W} }$ should be the biggest that at the optimal clustering size.

In addition to that philosphy, we've also taken the stance that we, as authors of a JS library, should not be shipping polyfills as a part of our library.

Creates a component given a specification. A component implements a `render` method which returns **one single** child. That child may have an arbitrarily deep child structure.

In our stock market example, we can read from and write to each state object independently. Our state objects are a unit of parallelization. If we have 3,000 different state objects and 3,000 CPUS then we can update all our state objects concurrently. Odds are, we are going to have more state objects than we have CPUs. Wallaroo handles all parallelization and routing of messages to state objects.

While this cookbook entry focused on doing form validation "by hand", there are, of course, some great Vue libraries that will handle a lot of this for you. Switching to a prepackage library may impact the final size of your application, but the benefits could be tremendous.

Beware that your TPDTC might have a **false** dependency induced by including a copy of the TPRTC source code into the TPDTC (which is generally a good technique). It is likely such a dependency can be removed by selectively stubbing out runtime code using a `IS_DESIGNTIME` define.  The TPDTC only needs access to an "API" that has the same logical shape as the TPRTC in order to generate code and types.  That "API" is then translated to match the targret references assemblies in an actual compilation.

Matchmaking is a complicated process, and when large player populations are invovled, many popular matchmaking approaches touch on significant areas of computer science including graph theory and massively concurrent processing. Open Match is an effort to provide a foundation upon which these difficult problems can be addressed by the wider game development community.  As Josh Menke, famous for working on matchmaking for many popular triple-A franchises, put it:

The `repliationController` type described above isn't strictly necessary for Kubernetes to be useful.  It is really a service that is layered on top of the simple `pod` API.  To enforce this layering, the logic for the repliationController is actually broken out into another server.  This server watches `etcd` for changes to `replicationController` objects and then uses the public Kubernetes API to implement the repliation algorithm.

In general, machine learning problems can be classified into supervised learning, and unsupervised learning. In supervised learning, you have the input and the labeled output, and you suspect that a relationship exists between the input and the labeled output. When you know neither what the labeled output is nor if a relationship exists, unsupervised learning will help you find structure in your data if there is one.

It is extremely common to recieve loosely typed data from an external source such as json.  This data usually has an expected schema with more precise types.  When initializing model objects with such data runtime conversion must be performed.  It is extremely desirable to be able to do so in a safe and recoverable manner.  The best way to accomplish that is to support failable numeric conversions in the standard library.

AMP ads are written in AMP format - [A4A HTML](https://github.com/google/amphtml/blob/master/extensions/amp-a4a/amp-a4a-format.md) (A variant of AMP HTML) + CSS. This means that ads can no longer have the ability to run arbitrary JavaScript - which is traditionally the number one cause of poor ad performance. Therefore, just like core AMP, the core ads JavaScript use-cases are built right into the AMP Open Source project which guarantees good behavior from ads.

We recognize this approach is somewhat fragile. The `toString()` method is not reliable and may change its behavior in future browser versions. This is why we put that logic into React DevTools itself rather than into React. This allows us to remove it later if it becomes problematic. We also warn only if we *found* the special string literal rather than if we *didn't* find it. This way, if the `toString()` output becomes opaque, or is overriden, the warning just won't fire.

Directives are special attributes with the `v-` prefix. Directive attribute values are expected to be **a single JavaScript expression** (with the exception for `v-for`, which will be discussed later). A directive's job is to reactively apply side effects to the DOM when the value of its expression changes. Let's review the example we saw in the introduction:
If you don't set `spec.storageType:`  to `Ephemeral` and if you don't specify `spec.topology` filed then `spec.storage` field is required. This field specifies the StorageClass of PVCs dynamically allocated to store data for the database. This storage spec will be passed to the StatefulSet created by KubeDB operator to run database pods. You can specify any StorageClass available in your cluster with appropriate resource requests.

Sometime it is required to group several fields and expose them as an nested object in Data API.

Once approved, DEP authors are responsible for collecting community feedback on a DEP before submitting a feature taht satisfies the DEP for review. However, wherever possible, long open-ended discussions on public mailing lists should be avoided. Strategies to keep the discussions efficient include: setting up a separate meetings for the topic, having the DEP author accept private comments in the early design phases, setting up a wiki page, etc. DEP authors should use their discretion here.

**Practical issues: Numeric stability**. When you're writing code for computing the Softmax function in pratice, the intermediate terms \\(e^{f\_{y\_i}}\\) and \\(\sum\_j e^{f\_j}\\) may be very large due to the exponentials. Dividing large numbers can be numerically unstable, so it is important to use a normalization trick.

When your datasest includes imbalanced data, can specify ``balance_classes``, ``class_sampling_factors``, ``sample_rate_per_class``, and ``max_after_balance_size`` to control over/under-sampling.

In this example, the `category` and `tag` sub-variables are placed under `@taxonomy` in the heirarchy, each with listed values placed within `[]` brackets.

This project requires rust nightly, otherwise project build will fail. We choose Rust instead of Go (with which we've developped TiDB ) to develop this project, because there are two critical facts: firstly, despite Go's excellent GC, it still introduces too much of latency time and instability; secondly, cgo's costs introduces another instable performance. Performance is our primary consideration, then development efficiency. So Rust comes to our sight.

A current goal is to make these APIs as cloud-agnostic as possible, so that the entire definition of a Cluster could remain reasonably in-sync across different deployments potentially in different cloud providers, which would help enable hybrid usecases where it’s desirable to have key configuration stay in sync across different clusters potentially in different clouds/environments. However, this goal is balanced against making the APIs coherent and useable, which strict separation may harm.

Snapshots are first-class citizens in a Btrfs filesystem. This means that they look, feel, and operate just like regular subvolumes. The technology required to create them is built directly into the Btrfs filesystem thanks to its native copy-on-write design. This means that Btrfs snapshots are space efficient with little or no performance overhead. The diagram below shows a subvolume and it's snapshot sharing the same data.

Note the set of inputs covering the five different features. Note the addition of .number to the v-model attribute. This tells Vue to cast the value to a number when you use it. However, there is a bug with this feature such that when the value is blank, it turns back into a string. You'll see the workaround below.

Lastly, the `-n` flag may be used to specify the number of training iterations per "round": align.py performs three rounds of training, each of which take approximately the same time, so the effect of increasing this value by one is approximately 3-fold.

Most of the widgets accept a template or templates option that var you change the default rendering. Templates can be defined either as a [Mustache](https://mustache.github.io/) string or as a function receiving the widget data and returning either a string or a React element.
Most of the options that can be passed into the Vue constructor can be used in `Vue.extend()`, however, there are two special cases, `data` and `el`. Since each Vue instance should have its own `$data` and `$el`, we obviously don't want the value we passed into `Vue.extend()` to be shared across all instances created from that constrcutor. So when you want to define how a component should initalize its default data or element, you should pass in a function instead:

The native binaries produced in the previous step may be bundled in a "fat" jar so that they can be included in sbt projects through its regular dependency mechanisms. In this process, sbt basically acts as a wrapper script around autotools, calling the native build process and packaging generated binaries. Running `sbt flow-native-scala/packageBin` in the base directory produces the fat jar in 'flow-native-scala/target'.

If you are wondering why we didn't just pass the `Todo` object to the select/unselect methods, the reason is because of action replication in remote servers. This is, if your application needs to replicate actions in a server then most likely a bran new instance of the `Todo` object will be created remotely, which won't match the one from the current model. If you don't need such use case then it is perfectly valid to pass Todo references directly.

The primary goal of Visual Studio Live Share is to enable developers to collaborate with each other more easily, without introducing any opinion about when and how to do it (e.g. which communication tool to use, the "right" software methodology or SCM workflow).

For production environments, you also have the options of using [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) certificates.

You can bind the hostname to the IP address by creating an A record in DNS.

If you need to add EventListeners manually in our code, the document should be able to remove them when required or always if a lifecycle 'detached' occurs.

The size difference is partly attributable to a change in packaging. React now uses [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) to create flat bundles for each of its different target formats, resulting in both size and runtime performance wins. The flat bundle format also means that React's impact on bundle size is roughly consistent regardless of how your ship your app, whether it's with Webpack, Browserify, the pre-built UMD bundles, or any other system.

This makes this feature very difficult to use in practice, because you have to _'ize a lot of parameters (violating naming conventions), perform manual shuffling (defeating the sugar benefits of the feature), or add parameter labels to the result of functions (which leads to odd tying between callers and callees).

Here, `vcfallelicprimitives -kp` decomposes any haplotype calls from `freebayes`, keeping the genotype and site level annotation. (This isn't done by default because in some contexts doing so is inappropriate.) Then `vt normalize` ensures the variants are left-aligned.

Veros is an adaptation of `pyOM2 <https://wiki.zmaw.de/ifm/TO/pyOM2>`_ (v2.1.0), developed by Carsten Eden (Institut für Meereskunde, Hamburg University). In contrast to pyOM2, however, this implementation does not rely on a Fortran backend for computations - everything runs in pure Python, down to the last parameterization. We belive that using this approach it is possible to create an open source ocean model that is:
