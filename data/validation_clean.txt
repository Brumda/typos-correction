You can install the osquery binaries on your hosts via the packages distributed at https://osquery.io/downloads or you can use the [Kolide Osquery Launcher](https://github.com/kolide/launcher). The Launcher is a light wrapper that aims to make running and deploying osquery easier by adding a few features and minimizing the configuration interface. Some features of The Launcher are:

Hypervisor-based containers have many application scenarios as well. Pouch will support it with runV and clear container.

The following steps show each Docker container being launched in detached mode and how to access the logs for those detached containers.  If you prefer to run the containers in the foreground, you can do so by replacing the ``-d`` ("detached") flag with ``-it`` ("interactive"). Containers launched in interactive mode will stream the log messages for the Confluent service directly to the terminal window.  For that reason, you'll need a separate terminal for each Docker image launched in interactive mode.

REST is the most popular software architecture on the internet today because it is founded on well defined, strict standards and it's easy to understand and expand. More and more websites are basing their designs on top of REST. In this section, we are going to have a close look at implementing the REST architecture in Go and (hopefully) learn how to leverage it to our benefit.

When you run unit tests in Xcode, the reporter generates a plist file, documenting all events that occurred during the tests ([More Information](http://michele.io/test-logs-in-xcode)).

The screenshots and the plist files are stored in the DerivedData directory, which `snapshot` stores in a temporary folder.

It is also strongly recommended that you do not run the service group with an even number of members.

Supervisors in a service group will warn you if you are using leader election and have an even number of supervisors.

Interceptors are similar in design to the $http interceptors.  You can add interceptors via the <code>RailsResource.addInterceptor</code> method or by explicitly adding them to the <code>interceptors</code> array on the on the resource <code>config</code> object.  When you add the interceptor, you can add it using either the interceptor service factory name or the object reference.  An interceptor should contain a set of keys representing one of the valid phases and the callback function for the phase.
At its core, dependency injection is just the principle of `"tell, don't ask"` put into practice; for instance, if a class needs to use the `MediaWikiApi`, it should be handed an instance of the class rather than reaching out to get it.  This has the effect of decoupling code, making it easier to test and reuse.

Imposter Syndrome is a feeling of _being a fraud_ or _not being good enough_ to get the job done. Common among software engineers, developers and designers working in tech companies, especially those not coming from a traditional tech background. People suffering from imposter syndrome have a sense of inadequacy and insecurity concerning their ability to make a contribution at the workplace. In reality, they may be perfectly capable of and do contribute successfully to their tasks.

Kafka delivery semantics in the case of failure depend on how and when offsets are stored.  Spark output operations are [at-least-once](streaming-programming-guide.html#semantics-of-output-operations).  So if you want the equivalent of exactly-once semantics, you must either store offsets after an idempotent output, or store offsets in an atomic transaction alongside output. With this integration, you have 3 options, in order of increasing reliability (and code complexity), for how to store offsets.
Back to `routes.js`, we now have two routes with onEnter callbacks assigned. First, `/home` route calls `requireAuth` to check if there is an authenticated user, redirecting to `/login` otherwise. Also, we have a route to catch `access_token=:token` url format and parse those parameters in `parseAuthHash`. The Login component does not exist yet, so let's create it.

When the speed of loading and preprocessing can't catch up with the speed of training or evaluation, IO will become the bottleneck of the whole system.

When created, each service is assigned a unique IP address.  This address is tied to the lifespan of the Service, and will not change while the Service is alive.  Pods can be configured to talk to the service, and know that communication to the service will be automatically load-balanced out to some pod that is a member of the set identified by the label selector in the Service.  Services are described in detail [elsewhere](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/blob/master/docs/services.md).

These sensitivities are actually log derivatives (:math:`\frac{d log(y)}{d log(x)}`); whereas a regular derivative is a tangent line, these are tangent monomials, so the ``1`` above indicates that ``x_max`` has a linear relation with the objective. This is confirmed by a further example:

The `InverseKinematicsSolver` was extended to simultaneously track the `OrientationsReference` if provided. (PR #2412)
It is not good practice to include a `na.rm = TRUE` in your summary commands by default; you should attempt to run them without this argument.  This is because removing missing data can have an impact on your analyses. In fact, an entire branch of the field of statistics deals with missing data. The take away point is that `na.rm = TRUE` should only be used after you become aware of the implications of its use (see the Learning Checks below for an example).

Deployment tools typically offer release management tools, most notably the ability to roll back to a previous release.  For example, the [Capistrano](https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano/wiki) deployment tool stores releases in a subdirectory named `releases`, where the current release is a symlink to the current release directory.  Its `rollback` command makes it easy to quickly roll back to a previous release.

The new approach also allows the 'ancestor' class to be attributed to menu items where the ``link_url`` looks like an ancestor of the current request URL. For example, if a menu item's ``link_url`` value is ``'/news/'``, and the request path is ``'/news/boring-news-article/'``, then the menu item will be attributed with the 'ancestor' class.

Most modern CPUs use a 64-bit architecture, which means they use 64 bit long memory addresses. Older CPUs used 32-bit, 16-bit, and even 8-bit architectures. The largest number a 64-bit CPU can store is 18,446,744,073,709,552,000. A CPU needs memory addresses to get specified values from the RAM. If we call the length of the memory addresses n, 2^n is the amount of memory cells a CPU can address.

The Laravel request lifecycle is fairly simple. A request enters your application and is dispatched to the appropriate route or controller. The response from that route is then sent back to the browser and displayed on the screen. Sometimes you may wish to do some processing before or after your routes are actually called. There are several opportunities to do this, two of which are "start" files and application events.

In conclusion, the purpose of sessions and cookies are the same. They are both for overcoming the statelessness of HTTP, but they use different methods. Sessions use cookies to save session ids on the client side, and save all other information on the server side. Cookies save all client information on the client side. You may have noticed that cookies have some security problems. For example, usernames and passwords can potentially be cracked and collected by malicious third party websites.

EntityX has switched to a more cache-friendly memory layout for components. This is achieved by requiring the use of `assign<Component>(arg0, arg1, ...)` and removing `assign(component)`. This allows EntityX to explicitly control the layout of components. The current layout algorithm reserves space for components in chunks (8192 by default).

The `render` method returns a *description* of what you want to render, and then React takes that description and renders it to the screen. In particular, `render` returns a **React element**, which is a lightweight description of what to render.

In its earliest days, React benefited tremendously from feedback, ideas, and technical contributions of early adopters and collaborators all over the company. While it might look like an overnight success in hindsight, the story of React is actually a great example of how new ideas often need to go through several rounds of refinement, iteration, and course correction over a long period of time before reaching their full potential.

If we know the source of the data, we can filter it. Filtering is a bit of a formal use of the term. The process is known by many other terms such as input cleaning, validation and sanitization.

Specifying `[count]` as a list of dependencies would fix the bug, but would cause the interval to be reset on every change. Effectively, each `setInterval` would get one chance to execute before being cleared (similar to a `setTimeout`.) That may not be desirable.

It lets us specify *how* the state needs to change without referencing the *current* state:

If you basecalled your run in parallel, so you have multiple `sequencing_summary.txt` files, you can use the `-f` option to pass in a file containing the paths to the sequencing summary files (one per line).

This is the view that the component is declared inside of. If the component itself has a view, this will be passed second.

Backend development has undergone tremendous change in the past decades. In the early days of the web, developers, and website providers had to buy and manage their own hardware to deploy and run servers on the internet.

Cache sweeping is a mechanism which allows you to get around having a ton of +expire_{page,action,fragment}+ calls in your code.  It does this by moving all the work required to expire cached content into an +ActionController::Caching::Sweeper+ subclass.

The log allows serial appends which always go to the last file. This file is rolled over to a fresh file when it reaches a configurable size (say 1GB). The log takes two configuration parameters: <i>M</i>, which gives the number of messages to write before forcing the OS to flush the file to disk, and <i>S</i>, which gives a number of seconds after which a flush is forced. This gives a durability guarantee of losing at most <i>M</i> messages or <i>S</i> seconds of data in the event of a system crash.

The semantics of `bindAsync` would be identical to the semantics of `bind` except it is asynchronous, so the name communicates that. Keeping the semantics and API as similar as possible minimizes the work need to transition between the two. We could also implement the asynchrony using promises, but a callback based API is more consistent with the rest of the existing API. In the future, promise support could be added, perhaps by returning a promise when no callback is provided.

We recognize this approach is somewhat fragile. The `toString()` method is not reliable and may change its behavior in future browser versions. This is why we put that logic into React DevTools itself rather than into React. This allows us to remove it later if it becomes problematic. We also warn only if we *found* the special string literal rather than if we *didn't* find it. This way, if the `toString()` output becomes opaque, or is overridden, the warning just won't fire.

Whenever an image file is uploaded to your specified Cloud Storage bucket, this mod creates a resized image with your specified dimensions. Both the original uploaded image and the resized image are saved in the same Storage bucket. The resized image file uses the same name as the original uploaded image, but but is suffixed with `_${param:IMG_MAX_WIDTH}x${param:IMG_MAX_HEIGHT}` in the filename. Note that you might need to refresh the dashboard to see the new file for the resized image.

Kubernetes leverages the concept of *resource versions* to achieve optimistic concurrency. All Kubernetes resources have a "resourceVersion" field as part of their metadata. This resourceVersion is a string that identifies the internal version of an object that can be used by clients to determine when objects have changed. When a record is about to be updated, it's version is checked against a pre-saved value, and if it doesn't match, the update fails with a StatusConflict (HTTP status code 409).

You can retrieve your data by passing a query directly into a simple fetch request:

If you have a global database connection pool for instance that is used by some kind of service layer, it is likely going to be difficult to test and they will be slow to run. DI will motivate you to inject in a database dependency \(via an interface\) which you can then mock out with something you can control in your tests.

The Angular CLI requires [Node.js and Node Packet Manager (NPM)](https://nodejs.org/en/). You can check for these programs with the terminal command: `node -v; npm -v`. Once installed, open a terminal and install the Angular CLI with this command: `npm install -g @angular/cli` or `npm install -g @angular/cli@latest` to install the latest version of angular cli. This can be executed from anywhere on your system. The CLI is configured for global use with the `-g` flag.

Currently, the most frequently used password storage scheme is to one-way hash plaintext passwords before storing them. The most important characteristic of one-way hashing is that it is not feasible to recover the original data given the hashed data -hence the "one-way" in one-way hashing. Commonly used cryptographic, one-way hash algorithms include SHA-256, SHA-1, MD5 and so on.

The code must be built into Java Archive (JAR) files and then deployed to an Azure Databricks cluster. The code is a combination of [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/) and Java, with a corresponding set of [Maven](https://maven.apache.org) project object model (POM) files to build the output JAR files. Understanding of Java, Scala, and Maven are recommended as prerequisites.

<strong>Going to production:</strong> If you're planning to go into production with your setup, you'll most likely not want your consumers to manually set the "<strong>Host</strong>" header on each request. You can let Kong and DNS take care of it by simply setting an A or CNAME record on your domain pointing to your Kong installation. Hence, any request made to `example.org` will already contain a `Host: example.org` header.

Every resource class defines a `toArray` method which returns the array of attributes that should be converted to JSON when sending the response.

This is because a resource class will automatically proxy property and method access down to the underlying model for convenient access. Once the resource is defined, it may be returned from a route or controller:

Hierarchical Clustering is a more complex method to cluster data points and evaluate the clusters. Unlike K-Means, we do not need enforce the number of cluster to look for in hierarchical clustering. The algorithm incrementally creates groups data points together to create cluster, staring with every data point as it's own cluster, until all the data in a single cluster. The results can be displayed in a diagram called a dendrogram which allows us to evaluate the possible combination of clusters.

- Added two new functions to create custom color palettes. For sequential palettes, you can use the :func:`light_palette` function, which takes a seed color and creates a ramp from a very light, desaturated variant of it. For diverging palettes, you can use the :func:`diverging_palette` function to create a balanced ramp between two endpoints to a light or dark midpoint. See the :ref:`palette tutorial <palette_tutorial>` for more information.

Creates a component given a specification. A component implements a `render` method which returns **one single** child. That child may have an arbitrarily deep child structure. One thing that makes components different than standard prototypal classes is that you don't need to call new on them. They are convenience wrappers that construct backing instances (via new) for you.

Form ‘N’ Fun is an android maze game based on real time computer vision. The uniqueness of this game is that the user can draw his own mazes on a white paper with pen/pencil and play. The game detects the maze and user can play using the accelerometer. This android app uses contours algorithms in OpenCV to detect maze that is drawn on the paper. This app uses JBox2d engine for simulating the rigid bodies.

But for other objects that I want to persist without a database, I do want a generic solution, and that is what the NoDb project is about.

We recognize this approach is somewhat fragile. The `toString()` method is not reliable and may change its behavior in future browser versions. This is why we put that logic into React DevTools itself rather than into React. This allows us to remove it later if it becomes problematic. We also warn only if we *found* the special string literal rather than if we *didn't* find it. This way, if the `toString()` output becomes opaque, or is overridden, the warning just won't fire.

There are many ways to solve the above problems. The simplest would be to just check the conditions in our containers and redirect. But since we have a few containers that need the same logic we can create a [Higher-Order Component](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/higher-order-components.html) (or HOC) for it. A HOC is a function that takes a component and returns a component. We are going to create two different components to fix the problem we have.

A computed property is used to declaratively describe a value that depends on other values. When you data-bind to a computed property inside the template, Vue knows when to update the DOM when any of the values depended upon by the computed property has changed. This can be very powerful and makes your code more declarative, data-driven and thus easier to maintain.

If you're using Auth0 with an identity provider that utilizes the WS-Federation protocol (such as Active Directory Federation Services, Azure AppFabric Access Control Service, and IdentityServer), the easiest way to set up your integration is to create and use the **ADFS** connection type. When setting up an ADFS-based connection,  you can import the required parameters by providing Auth0 with the **Federation Metadata** endpoint *or* by importing uploading your Federation Metadata file.

IoC bindings, like event handlers or route filters, generally fall under the title of "bootstrap code". In other words, they prepare your application to actually handle requests, and usually need to be executed before a route or controller is actually called. Like most other bootstrap code, the `start` files are always an option for registering IoC bindings. Alternatively, you could create an `app/ioc.php` (filename does not matter) file and require that file from your `start` file.

The size difference is partly attributable to a change in packaging. React now uses [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) to create flat bundles for each of its different target formats, resulting in both size and runtime performance wins. The flat bundle format also means that React's impact on bundle size is roughly consistent regardless of how you ship your app, whether it's with Webpack, Browserify, the pre-built UMD bundles, or any other system.

We recognize this approach is somewhat fragile. The `toString()` method is not reliable and may change its behavior in future browser versions. This is why we put that logic into React DevTools itself rather than into React. This allows us to remove it later if it becomes problematic. We also warn only if we *found* the special string literal rather than if we *didn't* find it. This way, if the `toString()` output becomes opaque, or is overridden, the warning just won't fire.

There is nothing "bad" about using state or lifecycle hooks in components. Like any powerful feature, they should be used in moderation, but we have no intention to remove them. On the contrary, we think they are integral parts of what makes React useful. We might enable [more functional patterns](https://github.com/reactjs/react-future/tree/master/07%20-%20Returning%20State) in the future, but both local state and lifecycle hooks will be a part of that model.

With this release, we're also introducing an entirely new session engine. Similar to the routing improvements, the new session layer is leaner and faster.

We use the [html-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/html-loader) to export HTML as a string and minify the output. This allows you to import your `src/index.html` within your `src/index.js`. We can simply minify the HTML with a loader option `minimize: true`, so this is why we leave it in the `webpack.common.js` instead of moving it to `webpack.prod.js`.

`IFilterFactory` implements `IFilter`. Therefore, an `IFilterFactory` instance can be used as an `IFilter` instance anywhere in the filter pipeline. When the framework prepares to invoke the filter, it attempts to cast it to an `IFilterFactory`. If that cast succeeds, the `CreateInstance` method is called to create the `IFilter` instance that will be invoked. This provides a very flexible design, since the precise filter pipeline does not need to be set explicitly when the application starts.

In other words, dev and eval are ~6800 queries out of the 55000 possible.

"Qiskit Terra is a software for generating quantum circuits, running them on a simulator or device (referred to as a \"backend\"), and processing the result. For a backend to work with Qiskit, it should be able to process a quantum circuit, which Qiskit passes as a ``Qobj``, and return a ``Job``. The ``Job`` allows for asynchronously tracking the run and returning a ``Result`` once complete.\n",

For example, $$f_X(x)$$ can take on values larger than one (but the integral of $$f_X(x)$$ over any subset of R will be at most one).

In its earliest days, React benefited tremendously from feedback, ideas, and technical contributions of early adopters and collaborators all over the company. While it might look like an overnight success in hindsight, the story of React is actually a great example of how new ideas often need to go through several rounds of refinement, iteration, and course correction over a long period of time before reaching their full potential.

Cloud applications run in a remote datacenter where you do not have full control of the infrastructure or, in some cases, the operating system. This can make management and monitoring more difficult than an on-premises deployment. Applications must expose runtime information that administrators and operators can use to manage and monitor the system, as well as supporting changing business requirements and customization without requiring the application to be stopped or redeployed.

This means that displaying 1000 nodes would require in the order of one billion comparisons. This is far too expensive for our use case. To put this number in perspective, CPUs nowadays execute roughly 3 billion instructions per second.

The GraphQL specification includes the following default scalar types: `String`, `Int`, `Float` and `Boolean`.

To enable this, GraphQL allows you to define custom scalar types.

But, ultimately the physical display only have a fixed number of pixels, for example 640×960 for iPhone 4 or 750×1334 for iPhone 6. iOS tries to be as faithful as possible to the user value by spreading one original pixel into multiple ones to trick the eye. The downside of this technique is that it makes the resulting element look blurry.

This pattern was almost never used in the wild, and supporting it causes React to be slightly larger and slower than necessary. So we are deprecating this pattern in 16.9 and logging a warning if it's encountered. If you rely on it, adding `FactoryComponent.prototype = React.Component.prototype` can serve as a workaround. Alternatively, you can convert it to either a class or a function component.

Orchestration functions often rely on the facilities provided by the `Orchestrator` trait and cannot live stand-alone. However, in many cases, re-use of the orchestration functions across multiple orchestrators are desired. In such cases it is important to separate the orchestration functions into a different trait(s) that will be mixed into each of the orchestrators. The following shows a sample of such a trait:
| `ProgressIndicator`   | No breaking changes                                                 |
c.Fatalf("Missing expected output on trusted pull:\n%s", out)
Please note that if it is apparent you ignored the instructions for reporting issues, your issue may be closed without review. When the guide isn‘t followed we get the same issues over and over. Having to repeatedly deal with the same solved and documented problems leads to maintainer burnout and a lot of wasted hours that could instead have been spent improving Homebrew-Cask itself and fixing real bugs.

BCrypt hashes are very secure. A hash is basically a fingerprint of the original data- always unique. This is accomplished by feeding the original data into an algorithm and returning a fixed length result. To further complicate this process and make it more secure, you can also <em>salt</em> your hash. Salting your hash involves adding random data to the original data before the hashing process which makes it even harder to crack the hash.

An Operator is essentially a pure function which takes one Observable as input and generates another Observable as output.

Alternatively, you can convert it to either a class or a function component.
Other than manually downloading the library, **ng-OfficeUIFabric** will be available in the following options.

The random approaches cut down the possible permutations before starting the scan, whereas non-random approaches cut down the permuations on-going based on results. For example, if batch sizes in the upper bound of the set parameter boundary perform poorly, they will be automatically reduced. Talos provides several ways to effect this process. These are covered in detail in the below section titled 'Input Parameters'.
In addition to that philosophy, we've also taken the stance that we, as authors of a JS library, should not be shipping polyfills as a part of our library. If every library did this, there's a good chance you'd be sending down the same polyfill multiple times, which could be a sizable chunk of dead code. If your product needs to support older browsers, chances are you're already using something like [es5-shim](https://github.com/kriskowal/es5-shim).

Or maybe “FBolt” was a nod to FaxJS – he didn't tell us! ;)

For each node configuration, `Authenticator` should be provided. `Authenticator` is a trait that the structure should implement so it can be used by CDRS session for authentication. Out of the box CDRS provides two types of authenticators:
The way this works is that you send a random value when starting an authentication request and validate the received value when processing the response. This requires you to store something on the client application side (in session or other medium) that allows you to perform the validation. If you receive a response with a state that does not match, you may be the target of an attack because this is either a response for an unsolicited request or someone trying to forge the response.

SQLite is an open source, embedded relational database. It has a self-contained, zero-configuration and transaction-supported database engine. Its characteristics are highly portable, easy to use, compact, efficient and reliable. In most of cases, you only need a binary file of SQLite to create, connect and operate a database. If you are looking for an embedded database solution, SQLite is worth considering. You can say SQLite is the open source version of Access.

The ASP.NET MVC 5 starter web template utilized ASP.NET's built-in support for bundling. In ASP.NET MVC 6, this functionality is better performed using client build steps, like we have already configured to manage our client-side dependencies. Instead of maintaining bundling functionality in a static configuration class that runs on the server, the minification and combination of files is done as part of the build process, using Gulp.
Let's explore this structure further. The `src/Vendor/Package` directory is the home of all of your package's classes, including the `ServiceProvider`. The `config`, `lang`, `migrations`, and `views` directories, as you might guess, contain the corresponding resources for your package. Packages may have any of these resources, just like "regular" applications.

Watches are long-running requests and use gRPC streams to stream event data. A watch stream is bi-directional; the client writes to the stream to establish watches and reads to receive watch events. A single watch stream can multiplex many distinct watches by tagging events with per-watch identifiers.

When needed it is possible to define a custom grouping strategy. A common use case is for alignment BAM files (`sample1.bam`) that come along with their index file.

Moreover, if the data sent to {es} is already in JSON format, it can be streamed in directly without any conversion to `Writable` objects.
Using the `audiosprite` project from NPM, you can concatenate a directory of mp3 files into a single mp3. This then binds the file name of each mp3 to the output mp3 in a `.json` file. By either naming the mp3 files or renaming the keys in the `.json` file, you can setup new sound names to be used in the experiment. This is how we implement "Cat Mode". I'm not going to spoil it, but if you dig around you can see how to enable it.

Fundamentally the best way to deal with merge conflicts is to, so far as is possible, **ensure they don't happen in the first place**. You can improve your odds on this by **keeping branches clean and focused on a single issue, and involving as few files as possible**. Before merging make sure you know what's in both branches, and if you are not the only one that has worked on the branches then **keep the lines of communication open** so you are all aware of what the others are doing.
This is all just scratching the surface of what is possible. For more details see the documentation for [Features and Actions](guides/features_and_actions.md), [Timeline](guides/timeline.md), [Focus](guides/focus.md), [Activities](guides/activites.md), [Routes](guides/routes.md) and [Action Stacks](guides/action_stacks.md).

Technically speaking, this is not absolutely necessary since you could also just _redefine_ identical `Post` and `User` types in `schema.graphql`. However, this would mean that you now have _two_ separate locations where these type definitions live. Whenever you now wanted to update the types, you'd have to do that twice. It is therefore considered _best pratice_ to import the types from Prisma's GraphQL schema.

Internally, `Diagnostics.LogFailure` adds a `try` operator to the `function` call. If the call fails, the `text` value is written to the trace before returning the original `error`. If the `function` call succeeds, the result is returned without writing anything to the trace. Since M errors don't contain a full stack trace (i.e. you typically only see the message of the error), this can be useful when you want to pinpoint where the error was actually raised.

The issue is solved by minifying and inlining the CSS in a style element in the header.  This is also known as compressing and internalizing what may otherwise be externalized content (such as CSS) into the HTML file.  This will avoid the delay of loading the externalized content and prevent the page "flash" or "flicker."  We recommend that that this is performed on the final version of content before production.  Minimized CSS is much harder to edit.

The default behavior for IncludeOS's syslog implementation is to send the data to printf, which again can be routed anywhere the service specifies. This is intentional since logging over a UDP/UNIX socket wouldn't necessarily work as one might think in IncludeOS, and there's unnecessary overhead using UDP if all you want is simple logging. Instead we provide an optional plugin for sending standard syslog over UDP to an external network interface.

Whenever you track an event or a page view it is stored in memory first. In every dispatch run a batch of those events are sent to the server. If the device is offline or the server doesn't respond these events will be kept and resent at a later time. Events currently aren't stored on disk and will be lost if the application is terminated.

Transitions API consists of two main building blocks. First one being `Transitioning.View` which is an extension of regular react-native view, so you can use any `View` props you'd like. The `Transitioning.View` is a root of all the transition animations that will be happening and is used to scope the changes to its children. In order to have next transition animated you'd need to call `animateNextTransition()` on the `Transitioning.View` instance.

You'll notice we *appended* to the feature set. Feature sets perhaps ought to be really called "lists." Each feature has an ordinal (its place in the list) in addition to a name. Some LTR training applications, such as Ranklib, refer to a feature by ordinal (the "1st" feature, the "2nd" feature). Others more conveniently refer to the name. So you may need both/either. You'll see that when features are logged, they give you a list of features back to preserve the ordinal.

When set to `true` setting new value to this property will trigger a new layout pass. This is done as performance optimization. Android has an integrated layout system so most of the time it will invalidate itself when needed. Thus we skip one native call by defining `affectsLayout` as `true` only for iOS for example using 'isIOS' boolean property. Because iOS doesn't have integrated layout system if you know that this property could affect the layout you should specify it in the `Property` constructor.

This makes it possible to add build-time optimizations such as [hoisting constant elements](http://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/transform-react-constant-elements/), safely lint and codemod internal component usage, and [include JSX source location](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/6771) into the warnings.

Sails recommends this general rule of thumb:  **Wait until you're about to use the same piece of code for the _third_ time before you extrapolate it into a separate helper.**  But as with any dogma, use your judgement!  If the code in question is very long or complex, then it might make sense to pull it out into a helper much sooner.  Conversely, if you know what you're building is a quick, throwaway prototype, you might just copy and paste the code to save time.

Finally, if we still can't match the license, we use a fancy math thing called the [Levenshtein distance algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance), which while slow, is really good at calculating the similarity between a known license and an unknown license. By calculating the percent changed from the known license, you can tell, e.g., that a given license is 98% similar to the MIT license, that 2% likely representing the copyright line being properly adapted to the project.

A computed property is used to declaratively describe a value that depends on other values. When you data-bind to a computed property inside the template, Vue knows when to update the DOM when any of the values depended upon by the computed property has changed. This can be very powerful and makes your code more declarative, data-driven and thus easier to maintain.

An immediate solution would be to design your own hash algorithm. However, good hash algorithms can be very difficult to design both in terms of avoiding collisions and making sure that your hashing process is not too obvious. These two points can be much more difficult to achieve than expected. For most of us, it's much more practical to use the existing, battle-hardened hash algorithms that are already out there.
Extending templating blocks is the best way to provide extra functionalities to authors.

For example, by default a `List` will render a `<ul>` element. This can be changed by passing a [React component](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html#function-and-class-components) to the `component` property. The following example will render the `List` component with a `<nav>` element as root node instead:

As mentioned above, **template names are global**. As a result of this, if two templates are declared with the same name the last occurrence will be the one that is used. Since templates in subcharts are compiled together with top-level templates, it is best to name your templates with _chart specific names_. A popular naming convention is to prefix each defined template with the name of the chart: `{{ define "mychart.labels" }}`.
The `MergeTree` engine and other engines of this family (`*MergeTree`) are the most robust ClickHouse table engines.
As you will soon see, if you were to modify the cluster topology, it wouldn't require any configuration changes at all. You simply run containers on different hosts, and only need to think about how many hosts are there and not what's running where exactly.

A recommended way of making sure your custom tables are present, is to use Migrations to ensure that the tables will be created or altered when starting your site. Migrations will ensure that if you are adding environments to your Umbraco Cloud site, then the tables in the newly created databases will automatically be created for you. Check [this blog post](https://cultiv.nl/blog/using-umbraco-migrations-to-deploy-changes/) for a full walkthrough of how to create and use Migrations.

While you could maintain multiple sets of divergent theme files to create different themes for your app's interface, the preferred (and easiest) way to accomplish dynamic theming is to largely share the same set of theme files across your entire app. An easy way to do this is to create a set of "mapping" theme files that _map_ your root constants from named values describing their _appearance_ to named values describing their _function_. For example:
// Errors are transformed into a purge status code and a message. We don't return

To use views in `Spots`, they need to conform to `ItemConfigurable`. It is a very lean protocol that has two required methods. The first is `configure(with item: Item)`, this is where our view gets the model information so that we can properly set texts to your label etc. The second function is `computeSize(for item: Item) -> CGSize`. This is used to give back an appropriate size for the view. It could return a static value or be computed based of the content coming from the model.
the received promises fails first gets handled by the rejection handler.

OverlayFS takes two directories on a single Linux host, layers one on top of the other, and provides a single unified view. These directories are often referred to as *layers* and the technology used to layer them is known as a *union mount*. The OverlayFS terminology is "lowerdir" for the bottom layer and "upperdir" for the top layer. The unified view is exposed through its own directory called "merged".

It is certainly possible to create a great app using React Native without writing a single line of native code, but React Native is also designed to be easily extended with custom native views and modules - that means you can reuse anything you've already built, and can import and use your favorite native libraries.

This means that displaying 1000 nodes would require in the order of one billion comparisons. This is far too expensive for our use case. To put this number in perspective, CPUs nowadays execute roughly 3 billion instructions per second. So even with the most performant implementation, we wouldn't be able to compute that diff in less than a second.

Initializes the `event.json`, `.env` files, and `deploy.env` files. `event.json` is where you mock your event. `.env` is where you place your deployment configuration. `deploy.env` has the same format as `.env`, but is used for holding any environment/config variables that you need to be deployed with your code to Lambda but you don't want in version control (e.g. DB connection info).
The `compose` utility function is provided by many third-party libraries including lodash (as [`lodash.flowRight`](https://lodash.com/docs/#flowRight)), [Redux](http://redux.js.org/docs/api/compose.html), and [Ramda](http://ramdajs.com/docs/#compose).
To learn how to test React components themselves, check out the [Jest tutorial for React](http://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/tutorial-react.html) and the [ReactTestUtils documentation](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/test-utils.html).
**Note:** The middleware placement is sensitive. If the middleware before `silk.middleware.SilkyMiddleware` returns from `process_request` then `SilkyMiddleware` will never get the chance to execute. Therefore you must ensure that any middleware placed before never returns anything from `process_request`. See the [django docs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/http/middleware/#process-request) for more information on this.

It is certainly possible to create a great app using React Native without writing a single line of native code, but React Native is also designed to be easily extended with custom native views and modules - that means you can reuse anything you've already built, and can import and use your favorite native libraries.  To create a simple module in iOS, create a new class that implements the `RCTBridgeModule` protocol, and add `RCT_EXPORT` to the function you want to make available in JavaScript.

Callback is now optional. You can also use synchronous syntax.
Coordinates are generally printed and spoken as latitude, then longitude ([lat,lon]). Geocoder respects this convention and always expects method arguments to be given in [lat,lon] order. However, MongoDB requires that coordinates be stored in [lon,lat] order as per the GeoJSON spec (http://geojson.org/geojson-spec.html#positions), so internally they are stored "backwards." However, this does not affect order of arguments to methods when using Mongoid or MongoMapper.
Anything compatible with a CommonJS-based build system works. A recommendation is using the [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/0.12/index.html) test runner together with its [CommonJS pre-processor](https://github.com/karma-runner/karma-commonjs) to test your code modually.
Controllers are typically tested using test libraries in the same language that they are written in.

Bias is a prejudice in favor of or against one thing, person, or group compared with another, usually in a way that’s considered to be unfair. Biases may be held by an individual, group, or institution and can have negative or positive consequences. For that reason, the benefits of prejudice can only exist at the expense of others. Therefore to be "biased for" something, you must be "biased against" something else.

The declarative model means that the code describes a _desired state_ and that some run-time is responsible for interpreting the code and establishing the desire state. A declarative approach is contrasted against an imperative or procedural approach. An imperative approach provides a set of steps to execute and a desired state can only be infer (at best) from the steps. Azure Resource Manager templates and Azure Policy are declarative.

Components are building block of your UI - similar to directives in angular, or modules and widgets in other frameworks. Components in React are more or less self sufficient in that they constitute the presentation (HTML) as well as the behavior (eg. event handlers). They are also composable - meaning we can easily use one component within other component. So how do we create a Component? There are couple common ways how you can create a React component.

Backend development has undergone tremendous change in the past decades. In the early days of the web, developers, and website providers had to buy and manage their own hardware to deploy and run servers on the internet. The movement towards the cloud removed much of that burden and let developers focus on the applications they wanted to build rather than infrastructure to be managed.

You don't need the Spring Cloud Function Web or Stream adapter at runtime in Lambda, so you might need to exclude those before you create the JAR you send to AWS. A Lambda application has to be shaded, but a Spring Boot standalone application does not, so you can run the same app using 2 separate jars (as per the sample here). The sample app creates 2 jar files, one with an `aws` classifier for deploying in Lambda, and one executable (thin) jar that includes `spring-cloud-function-web` at runtime.

Pony exceptions behave very much the same as those in C++, Java, C#, Python, and Ruby. The key difference is that Pony exceptions do not have a type or instance associated with them. This makes them the same as C++ exceptions would be if a fixed literal was always thrown, e.g. `throw 3;`. This difference simplifies exception handling for the programmer and allows for much better runtime error handling performance.

Luckily, all distributions, continuous or discrete, implement `generator`, which gives us what we need: a way to randomly generate new values from a distribution as part of the sampling process. Every `Distribution[T]` can give us a `Generator[T]`, and if we sample from a `RandomVariable[Generator[T]]`, we will get values of type `T`. (You can think of `Real` as being a special case that acts in this sense like a `Generator[Double]`).

SCRAM (Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism) is an authentication protocol that can establish mutual authentication using passwords. {ProductName} can configure Kafka to use SASL SCRAM-SHA-512 to provide authentication on both unencrypted and TLS-encrypted client connections. TLS authentication is always used internally between Kafka brokers and Zookeeper nodes. When used with a TLS client connection, the TLS protocol provides encryption, but is not used for authentication.

You can query a job's status using the [GET /api/v2/jobs/{id} endpoint](/api/management/v2#!/jobs/get_jobs_by_id). If the job is complete, the job status response will show summary totals of successful/failed/inserted/updated records, as well. If there is an error in the job, it will return as failed (however, note that invalid user information, such as an invalid email, for example, will not make the entire job fail).

Page HTML is written in a templating language where you can put Ruby between `{{` and `}}`. Volt uses data flow/reactive programming to automatically and intelligently propagate changes to the DOM (or to any other code that wants to know when a value has changed). When something in the DOM changes, Volt intelligently updates only the DOM nodes that need to be changed.
Alternatively, you could have achieved this by passing the `todo` an `isLastUnfinishedItem` prop, let it check this prop in `componentDidUpdate`, then animate itself; however, this quickly gets messy if you pass around different props to control animations.

One common solution to this problem is the introduction of a dedicated _data access layer_ (DAL) that abstracts away the complexities of database access. The DAL's API is consumed by the application server, allowing API developers to simply think about _what_ data they need instead of worrying about _how_ to securely and performantly retrieve it from the database.
If you intend to change the public API, or make any non-trivial changes to the implementation, we recommend [filing an issue](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/new). This lets us reach an agreement on your proposal before you put significant effort into it.

Normally, deleting an object from a public container will cause it to be eventually deleted from the CDN network, subject to the container's TTL. In some cases, though, you may need to have an object removed from public access due to personal, business, or security concerns. Currently the CDN limits this to 25 such purge requests per day. More than that will require that you open a ticket with Rackspace to handle the request.

When writing data to Influx, **all write methods accept NanoDates in all situations**. This means if you select data from Influx and want to update a data point, you can pass that time right back into the `write` method. (Remember, points within series are unique by their time!) If you have a nanosecond timestamp from some external source, you can convert it to a NanoDate using [`toNanoDate`](https://node-influx.github.io/function/index.html#static-function-toNanoDate).

However, when you import it, you’re actually holding the wrapper component returned by `connect()`, and not the `App` component itself. If you want to test its interaction with Redux, this is good news: you can wrap it in a [`<Provider>`](https://github.com/rackt/react-redux#provider-store) with a store created specifically for this unit test. But sometimes you want to test just the rendering of the component, without a Redux store.

We're going to fix this bug by introducing something we've dubbed the *AppState pattern*. The basics are that you want to add an object to the DI container that you will use to coordinate state between related components. Because the *AppState* object is managed by the DI container, it can outlive the components and hold on to state even when the UI is changing a lot. Another benefit of the *AppState pattern* is that it leads to greater separation between presentation (components) and logic

The `render` method returns a *description* of what you want to render, and then React takes that description and renders it to the screen. In particular, `render` returns a **React element**, which is a lightweight description of what to render. Most React developers use a special syntax called JSX which makes it easier to write these structures. The `<div />` syntax is transformed at build time to `React.createElement('div')`. The example above is equivalent to:

Sometimes, you need to have multiple submission buttons and need to know which button was clicked in your `onSubmit` prop callback. This can be achieved by passing additional information as an argument to the `handleSubmit` argument to your `<Form>`'s render prop. This argument will be passed to your `onSubmit` prop callback as a second argument. If your `onSubmit` prop callback is typed to make this extra data mandatory, the inner `handleSubmit` callback will require that data.

Initially, the idea was to build a proprietary uploader that would work exclusively with Transloadit’s commercial service, but we quickly turned around on it. We felt our version of a file uploader could have a real impact if we made it more widely available. So, just like Transloadit had done before with [Tus](https://tus.io/), we decided to make Uppy an open source solution — free for anyone to use and hack on. Transloadit support became an optional plugin.

* Firefox does not support cross\-origin CSP reports.  If we are using Firefox, AND the value for `:report_uri` does not satisfy the same\-origin requirements, we will instead forward to an internal endpoint (`FF_CSP_ENDPOINT`).  This is also the case if `:report_uri` only contains a path, which we assume will be cross host. This endpoint will in turn forward the request to the value in `:forward_endpoint` without restriction. More information can be found in the "Note on Firefox handling of CSP" section.

The current sample avoids this scenario because the plugin consumer is also the top-level composite build. Since the composite build does not contribute any dependency substitutions, it doesn't need to be configured until all of the included builds are configured. By this time the substitutions have been configured and the `buildscript` dependencies can be successfully resolved.
Following the previous example we can define a concrete class - _EventsEmitter_ - that implements the _EventsInterface_ interface.

`(onFileUploadFinish)="imageUploaded($event)"`. If `[url]` is specified this event is fired when component gets a responce from the server, also in this case event has field `serverResponse` which contains object returned by the server. If `[url]` is not specified it's fired immediately after an image(s) dropped into file-drop zone of choosed in file browser. So what you can do, is not specify `[url]` to handle upload yourself, for exapmple send the image into firebase storage. To get file use `event.file`.

The main actor in this pattern is the **dispatcher**. It acts as a hub for all the events in the system. Its job is to receive notifications that we call **actions** and pass them to all the **stores**. The store decides if it is interested or not and reacts by changing its internal state. The change is passed to the **views** which are (in my case) React components. If we have to compare Flux to the well known MVC we may say that the store is similar to the model. It keeps the data and its mutations.

When OpenGL was first created in the 1990s, drawing an object simply consisted in sending a shape alongside with various parameters like the color, lighting direction, fog distance, etc. But these parameters quickly became too limiting for game creators, and when OpenGL 2 was released a more flexible system was added with what are called *shaders*. When OpenGL 3 was released a few years later, all these parameters were removed and totally replaced by shaders.

ASM has previously changed its public API but added a mechanism for API compatibility starting with version 4 of the library. In order to avoid version conflicts with such older versions, Byte Buddy repackages the ASM dependency into its own namespace. If you want to use ASM directly, the `byte-buddy-dep` artifact offers a version of Byte Buddy with an explicit dependency to ASM. When doing so, you should then repackage *both* Byte Buddy and ASM into your namespace to avoid version conflicts.

When attempting to validate those inputs, it would seem that vee-validate thinks they are the same one depending on who got rendered initially. This is due to Vue actually re-using the input, so to `vee-validate` and due to some limitation in the `directive` API, vee-validate doesn't know that the input got switched. So you need to help it a little bit by using `key` attribute on the inputs which forces Vue to render those elements independently.

In this example, the filter is added to ApplicationController and thus all controllers in the application. This will make everything in the application require the user to be logged in in order to use it.

You can prevent this filter from running before particular actions with `skip_before_filter`:

Vue.js' precise dependency tracking makes it the one of the most efficient view layer for small hot updates, but there's always room for improvement.

With proper `track-by` usage, [re-rendering with large, brand new dataset](http://vuejs.github.io/js-repaint-perfs/vue/) is also comparable to, or even faster than other Virtual-DOM based frameworks.

To build this message a `ConversationReference` instance at [`invoke.RelatesTo`](PaymentsBot/Controllers/MessagesController.cs#L195) is used, and the conversation is resumed using the [`Conversation.ResumeAsync`](PaymentsBot/Controllers/MessagesController.cs#L207) helper.

- `observers`: this is an array of registered closures used to receive notifications about any change in Promise's current state. `Observer<Value>` is an enum with two types: first is used to get notification about fulfill events (`.onResolve(ctx: Context, body: (Value -> Void))`); the other is used for rejection (`.onReject(ctx: Context, (Error -> Void))`). Operators register observer to get notified about promise's events; each observer's body is executed into specified context.

The second, and more important thing, is that there is a huge community of Java programmers, which means you can find answers when you are stuck. This is very important because, as a beginner, you will face a lot of technical problems and you might not know where to head when you are stuck.

Core developers usually strive to optimize where to put hooks. In _Vue Storefront_, hooks generally fall under either of two groups. One of each is `listener`; it allows us to do something at certain moment of application lifecycle. The other of each is `mutator`; it allows us to modify internal objects before app performs some actions.

Note the set of inputs covering the five different features. Note the addition of `.number` to the `v-model` attribute. This tells Vue to cast the value to a number when you use it. However, there is a bug with this feature such that when the value is blank, it turns back into a string. You'll see the workaround below. To make it a bit easier for the user, we also added a current total right below so they can see, in real time, what their total is. Now let's look at the JavaScript.

When we pass multiple promises to the `Promise.race` method, it resolves/rejects the _first_ promise that resolves/rejects. To the `setTimeout` method, we pass a timer: 500ms for the first promise (`firstPromise`), and 100ms for the second promise (`secondPromise`). This means that the `secondPromise` resolves first with the value of `'two'`. `res` now holds the value of `'two'`, which gets logged.

In PHP 7.0, a [`Throwable` interface was added](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/throwable-interface) that allows catching and handling errors in more cases than `Exception` previously allowed. So, if the catch statement contained `Exception` on PHP 5.x, it means it should probably be rewritten to reference `Throwable` on PHP 7.x. This sniff enforces that.

Practically speaking, the difficulty in using a *(typed, pure) functional* programming language, is that the **functions that you write** between types **should behave like mathematical functions** on the corresponding sets. This means, for example, that if you call a function multiple times with the same arguments, it should produce the same result every time. This is often summarized as a *side-effect free function*. More generally, values are in principle immutable.
If the output is not the MAST json result type it cannot be properly parsed into an `astropy.table.Table` so the async method should be used to get the raw http response, which can then be manually parsed.

* **channel**: defines one or more channels used for the test. The 'deployed' property is used to define whether the channel has already been deployed (false as default when the property is missing).

To help defend against this type of attack it is important to use strong encryption and authentication between the client and the server. Using encryption the server authenticates the client's request by presenting a digital certificate, and only then can the connection be established.  For example, HTTPS uses the secure sockets layer (SSL) capability of the browser to mask web traffic. To decrypt HTTPS, a man-in-the-middle attacker would have to obtain the keys used to encrypt the network traffic.

At React.js Conf in January we gave a preview of Relay, a new framework for building data-driven applications in React. In this post, we'll describe the process of creating a Relay application. This post assumes some familiarity with the concepts of Relay and GraphQL, so if you haven't already we recommend reading [our introductory blog post](/react/blog/2015/02/20/introducing-relay-and-graphql.html) or watching [the conference talk](https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/v/9sc8Pyc51uU).

In this example, our render function returns a description of an `<input />` instance. But the true instance is accessed via `this.refs.theInput`.

Configuring layout for different components can be tricky, Spots helps to solve this problem with a neat and tidy `Layout` struct that lives on `ComponentModel`. It is used to customize your UI related elements. It can set `sectionInset` and collection view related properties like `minimumInteritemSpacing` and `minimumLineSpacing`. It works great both programmatically and with JSON. It is supported on all three platforms.

That's why BTCPay was created. To help merchants remove third party dependencies and simply use the Bitcoin Network freely and securely. Merchants have their own copy of the BTCPay software which runs on their own server or VPS of their choice and validates their own payments using their own node. It's a self-hosted Peer-to-Peer payment processor. The trade-off in this case is some technical understanding is required for initial setup.

<p> The use of compound data leads to a real increase in the expressive power of our programming language. Consider the idea of forming a "linear combination" ax + by. We might like to write a procedure that would accept a, b, x, and y as arguments and return the value of ax + by. This presents no difficulty if the arguments are to be numbers, because we can readily define the procedure
A better way of computing such integrals is via an approach called *importance sampling*. The main idea is to sample from a distribution $$q$$ (hopefully roughly proportional to $$f \cdot p$$), and then *reweight* the samples in a principled way, so that their sum still approximates the desired integral.

If you are not happy with the official templates, you can fork these templates, modify them to fit your specific needs (or even create your own from scratch), and use them via `vue-cli` too, because `vue-cli` can work directly on GitHub repos:
There was also the problem of non-determinism in the installed packages via `npm install`. Some of our CI builds fail because at the point of time when the CI server installs the dependencies, it pulled in minor updates to some packages that contained breaking changes. This would not have happened if library authors respected [semver](http://semver.org/) and engineers assumed that API contracts are respected all the time.

When you're writing code for computing the Softmax function in practice, the intermediate terms \\(e^{f\_{y\_i}}\\) and \\(\sum\_j e^{f\_j}\\) may be very large due to the exponentials.

Shoebox gives you great capabilities, but using it in the real app is pretty rough. Have you ever thought that such kind of logic should be done behind the scenes?

Sooner or later coupling with `shoebox` will spread over all routes.

Another example is one code chunk using a variable created from a previous code chunk. When the variable is updated in the previous chunk, this chunk's cache should be invalidated, too.

When we constrain the background view to another view, then it is actually constrained to the bounding box of that other view. If we were to apply a margin to that other view, then it would move the bounding box and so the background will move with it. However if we apply a padding to the other view then the position of the bounding box will not change (so the background view will not move) but whitespace will be added inside the bounding box.

Sometimes you may need to apply some JavaScript or CSS only to the current page. In those cases you can directly write root-level `<script>` or `<style>` blocks in the markdown file, and they will be hoisted out of the compiled HTML and used as the `<script>` and `<style>` blocks for the resulting Vue single-file component.
However, a function with intensive I/O processing or waiting for some synchronization might get a considerable performance increase.

* `prefetch: (pathname: string) => void` - Imperatively prefetch _and cache_ data for a path. Under the hood this will map through your route tree, call the matching route's `getInitialProps`, store it, and then provide it to your page component.

In the future, there may be more options to control cache behavior in the form of a function or time in milliseconds to keep that data around.

DQL overcomes this problem with subqueries and with complex but efficient subquery analysis. In the next example we are going to fetch first 20 users and all their phonenumbers with single efficient query. Notice how the DQL parser is smart enough to use column aggregation inheritance even in the subquery and how it's smart enough to use different aliases for the tables in the subquery to avoid alias collisions.

Column-folding behavior is almost entirely automatic. The only exception is gutter clearing behaviors on deeply nested items after column folding occurs - in some situations we can not know what columns are now first or last in their rows. This will cause the column to be inset from the edge of the container. The example below solves this by introducing `first-column` classes, along with `tablet-first-column` and `phone-first-column`.

The `lint` command is meant for confirming the code is valid and will `eval()` the code passed into the function.  Assuming there were no errors, the executed source code will then be injected back into the text replacing out the `\{\{::lint()}}`.  When you look at the raw `readme.src.md` you will see that the code can span several lines.  Remember the code is executed in the context of the running script so any variables will be available for the rest of the file.

The trick is to wrap the whole view hierarchy into `<Provider>{() => ... }</Provider>` where `Provider` is imported from `react-redux`. One gotcha is that **the child of `Provider` must be a function**. This is to work around an issue about how context (undocumented feature we have to rely on to pass Redux data to components below) works in React 0.13. In React 0.14, you will be able to put your view hierarchy in `<Provider>` without wrapping it into a function.

Specifying `[count]` as a list of dependencies would fix the bug, but would cause the interval to be reset on every change. Effectively, each `setInterval` would get one chance to execute before being cleared (similar to a `setTimeout`.) That may not be desirable. To fix this, we can use the [functional update form of `setState`](/docs/hooks-reference.html#functional-updates). It lets us specify *how* the state needs to change without referencing the *current* state:

But there was no way for us to tell that without a lot of research, and we were not going to have enough time for that research without delaying the release.

If you are including AFNetworking in a project with [Automatic Reference Counting (ARC)](http://clang.llvm.org/docs/AutomaticReferenceCounting.html) enabled, you will need to set the `-fno-objc-arc` compiler flag on all of the AFNetworking source files. To do this in Xcode, go to your active target and select the "Build Phases" tab. In the "Compiler Flags" column, set `-fno-obj-arc` for each of the AFNetworking source files.

The problem is that `PureComponent` will do a simple comparison between the old and new values of `this.props.words`. Since this code mutates the `words` array in the `handleClick` method of `WordAdder`, the old and new values of `this.props.words` will compare as equal, even though the actual words in the array have changed. The `ListOfWords` will thus not update even though it has new words that should be rendered.

The number of merchants using BTCPay grows each day. That is why the exchanges can develop integration with BTCPay and allow instant conversion of cryptocurrency payments into local fiat currency for merchants. Immediate conversion helps with mitigating the volatility risk and can be a new revenue stream for the exchanges. BTCPay takes away the centralization from payment processors and gives the opportunity for any exchange, regardless of the size or the country to integrate.

If you are a fan of CSS-in-JS, many of the popular CSS-in-JS libraries support Vue (e.g. [styled-components-vue](https://github.com/styled-components/vue-styled-components) and [vue-emotion](https://github.com/egoist/vue-emotion)). The main difference between React and Vue here is that the default method of styling in Vue is through more familiar `style` tags in [single-file components](single-file-components.html).
- `max-merge-region-size` controls the upper limit on the size of Region Merge (the unit is M). When `regionSize` exceeds the specified value, PD does not merge it with the adjacent Region. Setting it to 0 indicates disabling Region Merge. The default value is 20.

Make sure your current working directory is the `qotm` diretory, since we're going to mount that directly into the container.

A computed property is used to declaratively describe a value that depends on other values. When you data-bind to a computed property inside the template, Vue knows when to update the DOM when any of the values depended upon by the computed property has changed. This can be very powerful and makes your code more declarative, data-driven and thus easier to maintain.

The result of this code is an input element that we can focus but can't change. It is never updated because we have a single source of truth - the `App`'s component state.

There is nothing "bad" about using state or lifecycle hooks in components. Like any powerful feature, they should be used in moderation, but we have no intention to remove them. On the contrary, we think they are integral parts of what makes React useful. We might enable [more functional patterns](https://github.com/reactjs/react-future/tree/master/07%20-%20Returning%20State) in the future, but both local state and lifecycle hooks will be a part of that model.

* `$null` is a scalar. When the input (left side) to an operator is a scalar value, comparison operators return a Boolean value. When the input is a collection of values, the comparison operators return any matching values, or an empty array if there are no matches in the collection. The only way to reliably check if a value is `$null` is to place `$null` on the left side of the operator so that a scalar comparison is performed.

In this quickstart tutorial, you will learn how to build a GraphQL backend and deploy it locally with [Docker](https://docker.com/). The goal is to deploy a new Graphcool service that exposes a CRUD API for a simple data model. You will also add an API gateway that customizes the exposed operations using schema [stitching](http://dev.apollodata.com/tools/graphql-tools/schema-stitching.html) and [transformation](https://github.com/graphcool/graphql-transform-schema). Let's get started!
All [`SwaggerParser`](swagger-parser.md) methods accept an optional `options` parameter, which you can use to customize how the API is parsed, resolved, dereferenced, etc.

The ipwb indexer partitions the WARC into WARC Records and extracts the WARC Response headers, HTTP response headers, and the HTTP response bodies (payloads). Relevant information is extracted from the WARC Response headers, temporary byte strings are created for the HTTP response headers and payload, and these two bytes strings are pushed into IPFS. The resulting CDXJ data is written to `STDOUT` by default but can be redirected to a file, e.g.,

Bollinger Bands is a very simple but powerful indicator. There are three bands of this indicator. The mid band is the moving average on the price series (usually takes 20 lags). The upper and lower bands are two moving standard deviations away from the mid band. Bollinger Bands can be used to test for various types of strategies.

**You may rely on `useMemo` as a performance optimization, not as a semantic guarantee.** In the future, React may choose to "forget" some previously memoized values and recalculate them on next render, e.g. to free memory for offscreen components. Write your code so that it still works without `useMemo` — and then add it to optimize performance. (For rare cases when a value must *never* be recomputed, you can [lazily initialize](#how-to-create-expensive-objects-lazily) a ref.)

Mutation methods, as the name suggests, mutate the original array they are called on. In comparison, there are also non-mutating methods, e.g. `filter()`, `concat()` and `slice()`, which do not mutate the original array but **always return a new array**. When working with non-mutating methods, you can just replace the old array with the new one:

Having already learned about Pods and how to create them, you may be struck by an urge to create many, many pods.  Please do!  But eventually you will need a system to organize these pods into groups.  The system for achieving this in Kubernetes is Labels.  Labels are key-value pairs that are attached to each API object in Kubernetes.  Label selectors can be passed along with a RESTful ```list``` request to the apiserver to retrieve a list of objects which match that label selector.  For example:

Reorders can also cause issues with component state when indexes are used as keys. Component instances are updated and reused based on their key. If the key is an index, moving an item changes it. As a result, component state for things like uncontrolled inputs can get mixed up and updated in unexpected ways.

This first maps a line to an integer value, creating a new RDD. `reduce` is called on that RDD to find the largest line count. The arguments to `map` and `reduce` are Scala function literals (closures), and can use any language feature or Scala/Java library. For example, we can easily call functions declared elsewhere. We'll use `Math.max()` function to make this code easier to understand:
a dispatched command at all. In that case, you should use the single-parameter
# abbr tag, you can simply give a string as below.
Python permits you to use else with for loops, the else case is executed when none of the conditions with in the loop body was satisfied. To use the else we have to make use of `break` statement so that we can break out of the loop on a satsfied condition. If we do not break out then the else part will be executed.
Now links and images in your emails are from your custom domain. You only need to update your link branding if you want to update the domain that appears in the links in your email.

Now that your React Native component is created via `index.ios.js`, you need to add that component to a new or existing `ViewController`. The easiest path to take is to optionally create an event path to your component and then add that component to an existing `ViewController`.

Wherever something can be easily accomplished in plain JavaScript, Vue render functions do not provide an appropriate alternative. For example, in a template using `v-if` and `v-for`:
This special mode performs only spatial aggregation (using a grid defined by the requested tile and the resolution, parameter, as all the other cases), and returns a _random_ record from each group (grid cell) with all its columns and an additional `_cdb_feature_count` with the number of features in the group.
Don't be alarmed if yours isn't in the right order. When you print things out in an MPI program, each process has to send its output back to the place where you launched your MPI job before it can be printed to the screen. This tends to mean that the ordering gets jumbled so you can't ever assume that just because you print things in a specific rank order, that the output will actually end up in the same order you expect. The output was just rearranged here to look nice.

`smartCaret={false}` caret is not as "smart" as the default one but still works good enough (and has no issues on Samsung Android phones).

It is certainly possible to create a great app using React Native without writing a single line of native code, but React Native is also designed to be easily expended with custom native views and modules - that means you can reuse anything you've already built, and can import and use your favorite native libraries.  To create a simple module in iOS, create a new class that implements the RCTBridgeModule protocol, and add RCT_EXPORT to the function you want to make available in JavaScript.
The first version was based on SystemJS as the spec for JS execution, which became stalled when that spec was no longer supported.

Here we are encountering something new. The `v-if` attribute you are seeing are called **Directives**. Directives are prefixed with `v-` to indicate that they are special attributes provided by Vue.js, and as you may have guessed, they apply special reactive behavior to the rendered DOM. Go ahead and set `exampleVM2.greeting` to `false` in the console. You should see the "Hello!" message disappear.

JavScript is a **dynamimcally typed language**: we don't specify what types certain variables are. Values can automatically be converted into another type without you knowing, which is called _implicit type coercion_. **Coercion** is converting from one type into another.

In order to use React client-side in your application, you must make sure the browser requests it. One way to do that is to drop `react.js` into `app/assets/javascript/` and by default your application manifest will pick it up. There are downsides to this approach, so we made it even easier. Once you have `react-rails` installed, you can just add a line into your config file (see Configuring) and require react directly in your manifest:

For clarity, $SS_{B}$ measures the variance of all the cluster centroids from the dataset’s grand centroid (A big $SS_{B}$ value means that the centroid of each cluster will be spread out and they are not too close to each other), and given that we already know $SS_{W}$ will keep on decreasing as the number of clusters goes up. Therefore, for the Calinski-Harabasz Index, the ratio of $\frac{ SS_{B} }{ SS_{W} }$ should be the biggest that at the optimal clustering size.

The world contry graph structures its nodes like that: world -> continent -> country -> capital.

One using the named graph utilities (*worldCountry*), one without (*worldCountryUnManaged*).
Reorders can also cause issues with component state when indexes are used as keys. Component instances are updated and reused based on their key. If the key is an index, moving an item changes it. As a result, component state for things like uncontrolled inputs can get mixed up and updated in unexpected ways.

In addition to that philosophy, we've also taken the stance that we, as authors of a JS library, should not be shipping polyfills as a part of our library. If every library did this, there's a good chance you'd be sending down the same polyfill multiple times, which could be a sizable chunk of dead code. If your product needs to support older browsers, chances are you're already using something like [es5-shim](https://github.com/kriskowal/es5-shim).

Creates a component given a specification. A component implements a `render` method which returns **one single** child. That child may have an arbitrarily deep child structure. One thing that makes components different than standard prototypal classes is that you don't need to call new on them. They are convenience wrappers that construct backing instances (via new) for you.

An easy way to be more efficient is to convert your data to `CalendarDay`s outside of `shouldDecorate()`.
In our stock market example, we can read from and write to each state object independently. Our state objects are a unit of parallelization. If we have 3,000 different state objects and 3,000 CPUS then we can update all our state objects concurrently. Odds are, we are going to have more state objects than we have CPUs. Wallaroo handles all parallelization and routing of messages to state objects.
`update()` provides simple syntactic sugar around this pattern to make writing this code easier. This code becomes:

While this cookbook entry focused on doing form validation "by hand", there are, of course, some great Vue libraries that will handle a lot of this for you. Switching to a prepackage library may impact the final size of your application, but the benefits could be tremendous. You have code that is (most likely) heavily tested and also updated on a regular basis. Some examples of form validation libraries for Vue include:

If `true` the geocoder will always return results in the current map bounds. If `false` it will always search the world.

Beware that your TPDTC might have a **false** dependency induced by including a copy of the TPRTC source code into the TPDTC (which is generally a good technique). It is likely such a dependency can be removed by selectively stubbing out runtime code using a `IS_DESIGNTIME` define.  The TPDTC only needs access to an "API" that has the same logical shape as the TPRTC in order to generate code and types.  That "API" is then translated to match the target references assemblies in an actual compilation.

The `replicationController` type described above isn't strictly necessary for Kubernetes to be useful.  It is really a service that is layered on top of the simple `pod` API.  To enforce this layering, the logic for the replicationController is actually broken out into another server.  This server watches `etcd` for changes to `replicationController` objects and then uses the public Kubernetes API to implement the replication algorithm.

When configuring network of Pod, cri-containerd will take advantage of network plugins which implement CNI interface.

In general, machine learning problems can be classified into supervised learning and unsupervised learning. In supervised learning, you have the input and the labeled output, and you suspect that a relationship exists between the input and the labeled output. When you know neither what the labeled output is nor if a relationship exists, unsupervised learning will help you find structure in your data if there is one.

It is extremely common to receive loosely typed data from an external source such as json.  This data usually has an expected schema with more precise types.  When initializing model objects with such data runtime conversion must be performed.  It is extremely desirable to be able to do so in a safe and recoverable manner.  The best way to accomplish that is to support failable numeric conversions in the standard library.

Developing on a MacBook Pro and seeing animations, routing, complex UIs instantly appear is *not* going to happen on an average mobile device (especially in emerging countries).

Another difference between a `constructor` and a regular function is that Solidity takes care of automatically invoking the constructors of all ancestors of a contract. When writing an initializer, you need to take special care to manually call the initializers of all parent contracts:

This guide will walk you through the deployment of a Pachyderm pipeline to do some simple `edge detection <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_detection>`_ on a few images. Thanks to Pachyderm's built-in processing primitives, we'll be able to keep our code simple but still run the pipeline in a distributed, streaming fashion. Moreover, as new data is added, the pipeline will automatically process it and output the results.
On the Web UI offensive messages will now get moderated. For instance try to add "I DON'T LIKE THIS APP!!" this will get moderated to a - more civilized - non uppercase message: "I don't like this app.". Also messages containing swearwords (like "crap" or "poop") will also be moderated.

Dataflows can fail, at which point the error is emitted to the consumer(s). Sometimes though, multiple sources may fail at which point there is a choice whether or not wait for all of them to complete or fail.

When created, each service is assigned a unique IP address.  This address is tied to the lifespan of the Service, and will not change while the Service is alive.  Pods can be configured to talk to the service, and know that communication to the service will be automatically load-balanced out to some pod that is a member of the set identified by the label selector in the Service.  Services are described in detail [elsewhere](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/blob/master/docs/services.md).

We recognize this approach is somewhat fragile. The `toString()` method is not reliable and may change its behavior in future browser versions. This is why we put that logic into React DevTools itself rather than into React. This allows us to remove it later if it becomes problematic. We also warn only if we *found* the special string literal rather than if we *didn't* find it. This way, if the `toString()` output becomes opaque, or is overridden, the warning just won't fire.

To use the `config-translation` from your browser when you are **not** authenticated in circleci.com for a repository called `foo` in a GitHub org named `bar`, request the following URL and pass your `circle-token` directly in the query string. The following example calls this with `curl`, passes the `branch` to translate, and assumes your CircleCI API token is in an environment variable called `CIRCLE_TOKEN`.

On the Web, the application is built using the standard .NET tooling. The application is then transformed into a static website through the [Uno Web Boostrapper](https://github.com/unoplatform/uno.Wasm.Bootstrap), which uses [mono-wasm](https://github.com/mono/mono/tree/master/sdks/wasm) to run the C# code in the browser.

The Docker Hub has its own registry which, like the Hub itself, is run and managed by Docker. However, there are other ways to obtain a registry. You can purchase the [Docker Trusted Registry](https://docs.docker.com/docker-trusted-registry) product to run on your company's network. Alternatively, you can use the Docker Registry component to build a private registry. For information about using a registry, see overview for the [Docker Registry](https://docs.docker.com/registry).
A drop-in JavaScript textarea replacement for writing beautiful and understandable markdown. The WYSIWYG-esque editor allows users who may be less experienced with Markdown to use familiar toolbar buttons and shortcuts. In addition, the syntax is rendered while editing to clearly show the expected result. Headings are larger, emphasized words are italicized, links are underlined, etc. SimpleMDE is one of the first editors to feature both built-in autosaving and spell checking.

Directives are special attributes with the `v-` prefix. Directive attribute values are expected to be **a single JavaScript expression** (with the exception of `v-for`, which will be discussed later).

If you don't set `spec.storageType:`  to `Ephemeral` and if you don't specify `spec.topology` field then `spec.storage` field is required.

A **root type** is a type representation of the value used to resolve the fields of an object type. It is the object that will be passed as the first argument of `resolve`. It can be a plain JS object, a database model, a mongoose document, a JS class, anything that fulfills the contract defined by the GraphQL object type, based on the field definitions.
All methods should accept an optional options object, a string which targets a particular method, or null which initiates the default behavior:
"""Resets any additional state variables to their initial values.
Sometime it is required to group several fields and expose them as an nested object in Data API. For example lets suppose that an entity has two fields `intervalNumber` and `intervalUnit` but you need to expose them in API as `number` and `unit` properties of `interval` field. This can be achieved by the following configuration:

New to Bootstrap 4 is the Reboot, a new stylesheet that builds on Normalize with our own somewhat opinionated reset styles. Selectors appearing in this file only use elements—there are no classes here. This isolates our reset styles from our component styles for a more modular approach. Some of the most important resets this includes are the `box-sizing: border-box` change, moving from `em` to `rem` units on many elements, link styles, and many form element resets.

While you could write multiple sets of entirely different theme files to create themes for your app's interface, the preferred (and easiest) way to accomplish dynamic theming is to largely share the same set of theme files across your entire app. An easy way to just this is to create a set of "mapping" theme files that _map_ your root constants from named values describing their _appearance_ to named values describing their _function_. For example:

An `ARRAY` column can store a simple PHP array in the database (nested arrays and associative arrays are not accepted). The column setter serializes the array, which is later stored to the database as a string. The column getter unserializes the string and returns the array. Therefore, for the end user, the column contains an array.

**Practical issues: Numeric stability**. When you're writing code for computing the Softmax function in practice, the intermediate terms \\(e^{f\_{y\_i}}\\) and \\(\sum\_j e^{f\_j}\\) may be very large due to the exponentials. Dividing large numbers can be numerically unstable, so it is important to use a normalization trick. Notice that if we multiply the top and bottom of the fraction by a constant \\(C\\) and push it into the sum, we get the following (mathematically equivalent) expression:

From Spark's perspective, the only thing required is setting up serialization - Spark relies by default on Java serialization which is convenient but fairly inefficient. This is the reason why Hadoop itself introduced its own serialization mechanism and its own types - namely ++Writable++s. As such, +InputFormat+ and ++OutputFormat++s are required to return +Writables+ which, out of the box, Spark does not understand.
Installing the package manually is not recommended unless the above method failed. Note that you must have the requisite Python packages [see above] installed before installing QuSpin.

In summary, shadow carving always produces a conservative volume estimate that better reconstructs 3D shapes with concavities. The quality of the results depends on both the number of views and the number of light sources. Some disadvantages of this approach are that it cannot handle cases where the object contains reflective or low albedo regions. This is because shadows cannot be detected accurately in such conditions.

This project requires rust nightly, otherwise project build will fail. We choose Rust instead of Go (with which we've developed TiDB ) to develop this project, because there are two critical facts: firstly, despite Go's excellent GC, it still introduces too much of latency time and instability; secondly, cgo's costs introduces another instable performance. Performance is our primary consideration, then development efficiency. So Rust comes to our sight.

A current goal is to make these APIs as cloud-agnostic as possible, so that the entire definition of a Cluster could remain reasonably in-sync across different deployments potentially in different cloud providers, which would help enable hybrid usecases where it’s desirable to have key configuration stay in sync across different clusters potentially in different clouds/environments. However, this goal is balanced against making the APIs coherent and usable, which strict separation may harm.

The most beautiful thing is that Go has a lot of built-in logic syntax, such as anonymous fields in struct. Not suprisingly, we can use interfaces as anonymous fields as well, but we call them `Embedded interfaces`. Here, we follow the same rules as anonymous fields.

Snapshots are first-class citizens in a Btrfs filesystem. This means that they look, feel, and operate just like regular subvolumes. The technology required to create them is built directly into the Btrfs filesystem thanks to its native copy-on-write design. This means that Btrfs snapshots are space efficient with little or no performance overhead. The diagram below shows a subvolume and its snapshot sharing the same data.

Most of the widgets accept a template or templates option that let you change the default rendering. Templates can be defined either as a [Mustache](https://mustache.github.io/) string or as a function receiving the widget data and returning either a string or a React element.
Most of the options that can be passed into the Vue constructor can be used in `Vue.extend()`, however, there are two special cases, `data` and `el`. Since each Vue instance should have its own `$data` and `$el`, we obviously don't want the value we passed into `Vue.extend()` to be shared across all instances created from that constructor. So when you want to define how a component should initalize its default data or element, you should pass in a function instead:

If you are wondering why we didn't just pass the `Todo` object to the select/unselect methods, the reason is because of action replication in remote servers. This is, if your application needs to replicate actions in a server then most likely a brand new instance of the `Todo` object will be created remotely, which won't match the one from the current model. If you don't need such use case then it is perfectly valid to pass Todo references directly.

A state machine is a system that has a predefined set of states. At any given point, the state machine can only be in one of these states. Each state has a predefined set of transitions that can be derived from that state. These constraints are beneficial to application architecture because they provide a way to identify application state and suggest how the application state can change.

The size difference is partly attributable to a change in packaging. React now uses [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) to create flat bundles for each of its different target formats, resulting in both size and runtime performance wins. The flat bundle format also means that React's impact on bundle size is roughly consistent regardless of how you ship your app, whether it's with Webpack, Browserify, the pre-built UMD bundles, or any other system.

As long as a child component with `ref="theInput"` is returned from render, `this.refs.theInput` will access the proper instance. This even works on higher level (non-DOM) components such as `<Typeahead ref="myTypeahead" />`.

This makes this feature very difficult to use in practice, because you have to `_`'ize a lot of parameters (violating naming conventions), perform manual shuffling (defeating the sugar benefits of the feature), or add parameter labels to the result of functions (which leads to odd tying between callers and callees).

Pipeline Artifacts are the new way to move files between jobs and stages in your pipeline. They are hosted in Azure Artifacts and will eventually entirely replace FCS "Build Artifacts". Because moving files between jobs and stages is a crucial part of most CI/CD workflows, and because Pipeline Artifacts are expected to be the default way to do so, this spec proposes a YAML shortcut syntax for uploading and downloading artifacts. It also covers default download behaviors.

Veros is an adaptation of `pyOM2 <https://wiki.zmaw.de/ifm/TO/pyOM2>`_ (v2.1.0), developed by Carsten Eden (Institut für Meereskunde, Hamburg University).

We believe that using this approach it is possible to create an open source ocean model that is:

Through his FaxJS experiment, Jordan became convinced that functional APIs  — which discouraged mutation —  offered a better, more scalable way to build user interfaces. He imported his library into Facebook's codebase in March of 2012 and renamed it “FBolt”, signifying an extension of Bolt where components are written in a functional programming style. Or maybe “FBolt” was a nod to FaxJS – he didn't tell us! ;)

This library applies some techniques to help protect your app's users and attempt to thwart reverse engineers and attackers. BUT, this isn't guaranteed to stop your app from getting pirated. There is no such thing as 100% security, and a determined and skilled attacker with enough time, could remove these checks from the code. The real objective here is to raise the bar out of reach of opportunist and automatic attackers.
